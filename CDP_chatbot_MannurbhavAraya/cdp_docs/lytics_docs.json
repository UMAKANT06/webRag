    "title": "What is Vault?",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Introduction Vault is a centralized hub for managing security and other administrative features in Lytics. It provides a single place for Lytics admins to access and change their key security features and user permissions, regardless of product. This means that the controls set in Vault apply to Conductor, Decision Engine, Cloud Connect, and any other products associated with your Lytics account. Take a quick tour of Lytics Vault. Navigating Vault Vault is comprised of the following sections: Account Usage - an overview of your general account quota usage related to event consumption. Account Settings - view and change necessary administrative settings and details of your account. These are sectioned into the following categories. Account Details JavaScript Tag Lytics API Content Security Schema Users - view a list of users accessing your Lytics account, change their details or permissions, remove a user, or invite a new user to the account. Security Access Tokens - view and manage a list of Lytics API access tokens. New tokens can be provisioned with specific permissions. Authorizations - create, edit, view, and delete authorizations within Lytics. Authorizations are credentials to third parties that enable the necessary scopes and permissions for data import and export jobs to run. Account Setup JavaScript Tag - learn how to install the Lytics JavaScript tag and validate the installation. Who can access Vault? Vault is focused primarily on account admins or those that have permission to administer settings, user access, etc. Based upon these permissions, your experience in Vault may vary, and all sections outlined above may not be available. 📘 If you are unable to access a section please reach out to your account administrator to request those adjusted permissions. In general, Admins will be able to access all areas. Data Managers, Campaign Managers, Experience Managers, and Goal Managers can access the Authorizations section to manage the credentials for their jobs and experiences. Finally, all Lytics users, regardless of role, should have access to view the JavaScript tag installation page under Account Setup, and they should be able to view their user profile where they can change details such as their Name, Email Address, Phone Number (for two-factor authentication) and change their password. Your user profile will be accessible under the main Lytics navigation under \"Manage My Profile.\" Notable Changes For existing customers, slight changes will impact your day-to-day management activities. Product Switcher Vault will be available directly from the primary product switcher at the top left of your Lytics interface. This will be your primary access point for account management from now on. Account Usage Our account usage data and quota meters received a much-needed facelift. The usage metrics act as the Vault \"dashboard\" for admin users. Account Settings Account setting sections are now accessible through the main navigation. These settings have received a minor facelift update. The form controls for multi-text fields have been slightly updated for a more standard user experience. In addition, users are now prompted to save or discard their changes when navigating away from these pages with unsaved settings. Users The user list is now sortable and filterable based on name, email, who invited them, and how long they've been a Lytics user. Each user has a page to view their details and roles. In Vault, in addition to assigning new roles, an administrator can edit any user's name and email address. The user invite form is now on its page to improve the flow and experience of inviting users. Roles are now sorted into two categories - Admin or Custom Roles. An admin inherently has access to everything, while custom roles give a finer-grain definition of what the user can access. The details on each role are shown in a tooltip when you hover over the role name. Access Tokens The access tokens list is now sortable and filterable based on the name, description, the creator of the token, or when/if it has expired. You can now view additional details about the access tokens you've already created, such as the roles assigned, when it was made, and when it will expire. In addition, new access tokens can now be assigned as an admin or with any combination of more granular access roles. Authorizations Authorizations are now to be created and updated only in Vault. You will still be able to utilize the auths you create in Vault in other products, but for example, when creating a job in Conductor or Decision Engine, if you don't see an authorization you want to use for that job, you will be linked into the authorizations wizard within Vault to create the auth.

The decisioning capabilities of Lytics can be combined with the personalized activation proficiency of the Adobe products: Adobe Campaign Adobe Analytics Adobe Target Adobe Ad Cloud Adobe Audience Manager Options for sending data from Lytics to Adobe: Sending file based data directly to Adobe using a Lytics File Servce Sending data in near real time from Lytics to one of our supported data warehouse integrations ( Google BigQuery , Microsoft Azure , Snowflake , Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift ). Then from the data warehouse, send the data to Adobe Cloud Client Side - Lytics surfaces data in Web Layer via the Lytics JavaScript Tag. Learn how you can via the Lytics tag here. Options for sending data from Adobe to Lytics: From Adobe send data to a Lytics Supported data warehouse  ( Google BigQuery , Microsoft Azure , Snowflake , Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift ). The data from the data warehouse can be imported into Lytics. In many cases this is the recommended approach to avoid duplication of processes and data storage. Sending file based data from Adobe to Lytics using a Lytics File Service Client Side - Using the Lytics JavaScript Tag [link] to pass Information to Lytics from the website / data layer Further details on integrating with Adobe products Adobe Campaign Lytics can export file based data to Adobe Campaign via hourly/daily CSV file export to an SFTP location. Adobe Campaign can import CSV files from its own secure location. This is more of a limitation on the Adobe Campaign side regarding limited API access. Adobe Analytics There are many ways to get data into Lytics from Adobe Analytics. One common method is to use the Lytics Javascript tag (jstag.send) function to send eVars directly from the data layer into Lytics on page load. This method will simplify the onboarding process and minimize the need to do a data transfer from Adobe Analytics on a regular basis. As part of onboarding, we can help identify which data you would like to pull in for activation and identify the right mechanisms for ingestion. Lytics provides ways to ingest this data from scheduled SFTP pickups to Bulk API imports or transactional APIs. Adobe Target Our Javascript Tag will communicate user audience membership to Adobe Target, which will respond with the appropriate site personalizations.  This Lytics data will be returned from our platform on page load and the Users Profile, segmentation information and content recommendations will be placed in the web page data layer. You can pass this information simply by leveraging the lio.data.segments object that is loaded onto every page where the Lytics JS tag is deployed. Adobe Ad Cloud Similar to other Adobe products, Adobe Ad Cloud supports the consumption of user audiences via SFTP, Json file upload, API (Lytics can create a webhook to stream data - but more conversation with Adobe will be needed) as well as direct from other Adobe products like Adobe Audience Manager. Lytics can also directly send audiences from Lytics into ad platforms (e.g. Facebook, Google, Linkedin, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, LiveRamp.  With our Google partnership, Lytics has early access to Google’s API-based integration for custom audiences within DV360. Adobe Audience Manager We can deliver audiences into Audience Manager via SFTP or Data Warehouse integration, similar to how the above integrations have been documented. Updated 28 days ago",

    "title": "Insights",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Introduction Lytics Insights provide visibility into how your audiences and campaigns perform and recommend how you may improve engagement, drive conversions, and increase marketing ROI. You can think of Lytics Insights as a way to connect the data you have with the decisions you are making for marketing campaigns. Defined in a few words, Lytics Insights are: Actionable : Direct knowledge to your marketing initiatives. Contextual : Provide actions that are relevant to the Lytics user consuming them. Explanatory : Describe phenomena in terms of your business processes or outcomes. Novel : Offer a new understanding of your customers and campaigns. Insights serve as a key ingredient to achieve marketing personalization. To effectively leverage customer data, you must apply it throughout your campaign planning and execution process. Unlike metrics that remain on a BI dashboard or report, Lytics Insights are designed be immediately activated in your segmentation and campaign strategies. If your account package includes Insights, you can access Insights from anywhere in the Lytics UI. How Insights Work Insights surface meaningful data and recommended action, enabling you to make better, data-driven decisions during your campaign planning and execution. The core idea behind Insights is simple. Insights are a combination of facts and actions: Fact : Observable, data-driven information providing demonstrable value. This is a unique set of raw metrics, such as the number of users or the amount of lift. Action : Suggested behavior based on user role, data source, activation channels, industry, etc. This is the contextualization of a fact into something to be done. Insights are made possible thanks to the data science capabilities built into Lytics. The heavy lift of processing and interpreting data is automatically handled by machine learning models under-the-hood. This is a prime example of how machine learning can augment (not replace) a marketer’s role. Machines efficiently and accurately sift through lots of data, allowing people to then make use of the important information in the most relevant context. For example, a model can predict which users are most likely to churn, and a marketer can then target those at-risk users with a win-back campaign on Facebook. Insight Cards Insights are presented as Insight Cards that are available throughout the entire app. Simply navigate to the left-hand side of the Lytics UI to open the Insights Drawer , which contains a list of Insight Cards unique to your account. Below is an example of an Insight card and what it's comprised of: Creation date : When the Insight was generated. Expiration date : When the Insight will be removed from the drawer. Insights expire after 2 weeks. Insight statement : The explanation or comparison of noteworthy data will depend on the type of Insight. You can click on an audience name to view its summary report. Recommended action : Lytics will suggest how you can apply this Insight to your targeting along with a related use case. Expanded definition : View more details by clicking the arrow. This example explains the Lytics score or other data field being calculated. Insights are generated and refreshed on a weekly basis to ensure you are viewing the most recent user data. Insights expire after 2 weeks, so you only target and activate an audience and campaigns during a relevant time frame. The Insights Drawer will display a maximum of 25 cards at a time. Insights will be created for up to 10 custom audiences , in addition to Lytic's out-of-the-box engagement audiences. Lytics will prioritize Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences. Compositional Insights Compositional Insights help you understand the makeup of your audiences. This information can answer, “what makes an audience unique?” and “How should I target these users differently?” Compositional Insights make it easier for you to create effective segmentation strategies. They compare data fields within audiences to surface which attributes drive user behavior. Compositional Insights currently include the following: Audience Pairs This Insight compares high-value audiences on their levels of engagement. This can take the form of comparing Lytic's out-of-the-box audiences on a particular behavioral score or a custom audience. As a bite-size piece of information, this Insight Card has provided: An easy way to leverage Lytics audiences and scores that are derived from data science. A suggested next step of what to do with this information. For example, you may target these at-risk users with a win-back campaign. Field Candidates This Insight compares the prevalence of specific data fields within two audiences. Candidates included are fields used in audience definitions and fields from the Promoted Schema Fields in your Account Settings . Having a granular understanding of your audiences allows you to make more strategic targeting decisions. For example, there may be a data field that your organization is paying to collect. If you discover through an Insight Card that this field is not performing as expected in your campaigns, you could save marketing spend by eliminating that field and using others that are shown to be more predictive of user behavior. Experience Insights Experience Insights help you track and understand campaign performance. This information can answer, “Which campaigns are resonating with my users?” and “Are my marketing tactics driving engagement or conversions?” Experience Insights allow you to refine campaigns based on current metrics proactively. Since Lytics Insights are generated and refreshed every week, you can take action to improve a campaign while it’s running. Experience Insights include the following types: Experience Management This Insight will surface when an experience is missing UTM parameters, which enable Lytics to track conversions from downstream tools such as Facebook. While this Insight is more straightforward than the other types Lytics offers, it helps you quickly identify when an Experience configuration is incomplete, affecting your ability to track performance and target users who have previously engaged in future campaigns. Experience Performance This Insight appears when a significant spike up or down in campaign performance exists. Awareness of such incidents allows you to make the necessary changes to improve campaign ROI. For example, if conversion rates have rapidly declined for a particular campaign in the last week, you may need to reevaluate and consider changes such as refining your audience, messaging, or campaign tactics. Activating Insights Taking action based on your Insights is the most important part of the process. As the introduction explains, Lytics Insights are designed to be actionable. By understanding how users interact with your brand at a granular level, you can iterate campaigns to improve their performance and deliver better user experiences. Activating against Lytics Behavioral Scores User engagement is a crucial component of personalization. Each Lytics Score (quantity, frequency, recency, intensity, momentum, propensity) indicates a different aspect of user behavior,  but overall, higher scores indicate high engagement, while lower scores indicate low engagement. Below are some everyday use cases you might consider, depending on whether the target audience has higher behavioral scores (anything above 50) or lower behavioral scores (anything below 50). Targeting Users with Low Engagement There are two main approaches to reaching unengaged users. The first is to drive engagement using a variety of tactics, such as messaging on different channels, targeting based on content affinities, etc. The second approach is to increase marketing efficiency by suppressing these users, thus improving your conversions. Targeting Users with High Engagement When creating strategies around your most active users, you will want to keep them engaged by delivering relevant content and establishing a first-party relationship that increases their Lifetime Value (LTV). You can find more users who are similar to your best customers using lookalike audiences. You can also learn more about what makes these engaged users different, which can inform your overall targeting strategies. View the Audience summary by clicking the audience name on your Insight Card to see the history of this audience and its characteristics. Activating against Lytics Content Affinity Giving your users more of what they love is a great tactic to consider to either drive engagement for less active users or to keep currently active users engaged.

    "content": "Lytics offers a wide range of pre-packaged user attributes, including automatically generated and customizable ones. Additionally, Lytics employs predictive modeling and machine learning algorithms to provide insights and scores, allowing users to gain a deeper understanding of their audience. The guide below provides an overview of all available attributes and examples to enhance your profiling efforts. 👍 If you haven't already reviewed our documentation on collecting events via our JavaScript SDK, we highly recommend doing so first. This will give you a better understanding of how data collection works at a high level before delving into the specifics of what can be collected. Available Attributes The following attributes are all available out of the box with no customization necessary in all Lytics pricing tiers. Do note that any attributes flagged as Computed can not be edited directly but are computed based on various factors, including other non-computed attributes. 📘 For a more comprehensive example of how any of the following attributes can be collected and used for your visitors click the name of the identifier to access the code examples below. Identifiers Default attributes that are used to stitch profiles together. For instance, if you pass an email along with the _uid , all events that have only been associated with either identifier will be merged into a single comprehensive profile. Name Slug Description Computed Example Lytics ID _id A unique ID that represents the materialized profile in Lytics. Yes 4fafb5b3-b199-58f2-a68b-4b266b363dd1 Current Lytics Cookie _uid The current cookie id for the user.

      "These scores represent an aggregate summary of the user's behavior across various dimensions: Consistency, Frequency, Intensity, Maturity, Momentum, Propensity, Quantity, Recency, and Volatility. Interests Lytics Content ( lytics_content ) The interest attributes are computed in real-time and represent the user's interest in various topics. These topics are generated as a result of the analysis done by the Lytics Interest Engine and then associated with the user based upon their interaction with content on your site. Intelligence Segment Membership ( _segments ) This attribute displays an array of all segments the user is currently a member of. It updates in real-time based on various audience definitions. Lytics offers a range of useful segments out of the box, requiring no additional setup. For detailed information on these audiences, refer to our Developer Tier > Audiences documentation. Split & Split2 ( _split & _split2 ) These attributes are automatically generated by Lytics and represent a random value evenly distributed across users. They are useful for split testing and experimentation. Needs Message ( needs_message ) This attribute is computed in real-time and represents the relative distance between now and the next predicted event. It is stream specific and is useful for understanding when a user is likely to engage again. Next Event ( next_event ) This attribute is computed in real-time and represents the next expected event. It is stream specific and is useful for understanding when a user is likely to engage again. Lookalike Model Predictions & Lookalike Model Percentiles ( segment_prediction & segment_prediction_percentile ) This attribute is computed in real-time and represents the scores resulting from Lytics Lookalike and SegmentML models. Out-of-the-box, Lytics offers a range of useful models, requiring no additional setup. For detailed information on these models, refer to our Developer Tier > Models documentation. Activity General First Seen & Last Seen ( event_first_seen & event_last_seen ) Both of these attributes are automatically populated based upon the _e value in the jstag.send payload. By default Lytics will collect a pv event for each page view and this will automatically populate the first_seen and last_seen attributes. Below is an example of collecting a custom event that would populate these attributes as well. JavaScript jstag.send({\n  _e:\"custom_event\"\n});``` Channels ( channels ) [needs update] JavaScript jstag.send({\n  _channel:\"web\",\n}); Devices ( devices ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  _device:\"desktop\",\n}); Hourly ( hourly ) This attribute is automatically populated with a count of events per hour for the user. Hour of Week ( hourofweek ) This attribute is automatically populated with a count of events per hour of the week for the user. Last Active Timestamp ( last_active_ts ) This attribute is automatically populated with the last time an event was received in any stream for the user. Last Channel Activities ( last_channel_activities ) [needs update] JavaScript jstag.send({\n  _channel:\"web\",\n}); Web Domains ( domains ) This attribute is automatically populated with the domains the user has been active on. First Visit Timestamp ( firstvisit_ts ) This attribute is automatically populated with the first time the user visited the site and sends data to the default stream. Last Visit Timestamp ( lastvisit_ts ) This attribute is automatically populated with the last time the user visited the site and sends data to the default stream. Pageview Count ( pageviewct ) This attribute is automatically populated with the number of _pv events recieved for the user. JavaScript jstag.send({\n  _e:\"pv\"\n}); Referring Domain ( refdomain ) This attribute is automatically populated with the referring domain for the user. JavaScript jstag.send({\n  _ref:\"umami.lytics.com\",\n}); User Agent ( user_agent ) This attribute is automatically populated based on the user agent of the browser. This attribute must be turned on in your Lytics account to be collected. Visit Count ( visitct ) This attribute is automatically populated with the number of visits the user has had based on presence of the _sesstart key in an event. JavaScript jstag.send({\n  _sesstart:1\n}); Visit City ( visit_city ) This attribute is automatically populated with the city the user visited from based upon GeoIP. Visit Country ( visit_country ) This attribute is automatically populated with the country the user visited from based upon GeoIP. Visit Region ( visit_region ) This attribute is automatically populated with the region the user visited from based upon GeoIP. Form Data ( form_data ) Form data is a wildcard attribute that allows you to pass a number of key value pairs that all get stored under the form_data attribute. This is useful for capturing form submissions. JavaScript jstag.send({\n  formdata_fn:\"John\",\n  formdata_ln:\"Doe\",\n  formdata_someotherkey:\"somevalue\"\n}); Forms Submitted ( forms_submitted ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  form_name:\"newsletter\"\n}); UTM Campaign Last ( utm_campaign_last ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  utm_campaign:\"holiday\"\n}); UTM Campaigns ( utm_campaigns ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  utm_campaign:\"holiday\"\n}); UTM Content Last ( utm_content_last ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  utm_content:\"recipe-1\"\n}); UTM Contents ( utm_contents ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  utm_content:\"recipe-1\"\n}); UTM Medium Last ( utm_medium_last ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  utm_medium:\"article\"\n}); UTM Mediums ( utm_mediums ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  utm_medium:\"article\"\n}); UTM Source Last ( utm_source_last ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  utm_source:\"google_ads\"\n}); UTM Sources ( utm_sources ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  utm_source:\"google_ads\"\n}); UTM Term Last ( utm_term_last ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  utm_term:\"example\"\n}); UTM Terms ( utm_terms ) JavaScript jstag.send({\n  utm_term:\"example\"\n}); Campaign Hover ( ly_hover ) [needs update] JavaScript jstag.send({\n  pf_widget_id: \"content-rec-modal\",\n  pf-widget-event: \"hover\"\n}); Impressions ( ly_impressions ) [needs update] JavaScript jstag.send({\n  pf_widget_id: \"content-rec-modal\",\n  pf-widget-event: \"show\"\n}); Closes ( ly_closes ) [needs update] JavaScript jstag.send({\n  pf_widget_id: \"content-rec-modal\",\n  pf-widget-event: \"close\"\n}); Conversions ( ly_conversions ) [needs update] JavaScript jstag.send({\n  pf_widget_id: \"content-rec-modal\",\n  pf-widget-event: \"conversion\"\n}); Milestones ( ly_milestones ) [needs update] JavaScript jstag.send({\n  pf_widget_id: \"engaged-donation-page\",\n  pf-widget-event: \"milestone\"\n}); Goals ( ly_goals ) [needs update] JavaScript jstag.send({\n  pf_widget_id: \"made-donation\",\n  pf-widget-event: \"goal\"\n}); Updated 11 months ago Default Segments"

    "title": "Snowflake",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Overview Snowflake is a cloud-based data platform that allows for easy and reliable access to your data. Integrating Lytics with Snowflake allows you to seamlessly import your Snowflake data into Lytics to leverage Lytics' segmenting and insights capabilities. Lytics audiences can also be exported in bulk to Snowflake for auditing, querying, and reporting. Authorization If you haven't already done so, you will need to set up a Snowflake account before you begin the process described below. For imports, you will need to provide the credentials and role for a user who has access to the data you wish to import. For exports, you will need to provide the credentials and role for a user who has access to the database and schema you wish to export to. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see the Authorizations documentation for more information. Select Snowflake from the list of providers. Select the method for authorization. Note that different methods may support different job types. Snowflake supports the following authorization methods: Snowflake Direct Authorization Snowflake Direct Authorization for Bulk Export Enter a Label to identify your authorization. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your authorization. Complete the configuration steps needed for your authorization. These steps will vary by method. Click Save Authorization . Snowflake Direct Authorization Enter the Snowflake Account that contains the data you want to import. See Snowflake's Account Identifier documentation for details on account name format. Enter the Snowflake Warehouse you will run the extraction queries against. For more information, see Snowflake's Warehouse documentation . Enter the Snowflake Database that contains the data you want to import. Enter the Snowflake Username of a Snowflake user who has access to the data you want to import. Enter the Snowflake Role you will run extraction queries with. Make sure this role has access to the data you want to import. For import, the role will need usage on the database usage on the schema operate and usage on the warehouse For more information, see Snowflake's Roles documentation . Enter your user's Snowflake Password . Snowflake Direct Authorization for Bulk Export Enter your Snowflake Account account locator, ex. xy12345.us-east-aws . Be sure to format the locator according to your cloud platform and region, as described here: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html#locator-formats-by-cloud-platform-and-region Enter the Snowflake Warehouse you will run the load queries against. For more information, see Snowflake's Warehouse documentation . Enter the Snowflake Database you wish to export to. Enter the Username of a Snowflake user who has access to the schema you wish to export to. Enter the Snowflake Role you will run load queries with. Make sure this role has write permissions on the database and schema you wish to export to. For export, the role will need usage on the database usage and create table on the schema operate and usage on the warehouse For more information, see Snowflake's Roles documentation . Enter your user's Snowflake Password . In the GCS Stage Service Account text box, enter your GCS Stage Service Account. Import Data Import data from a Snowflake table or view into Lytics, resulting in new user profiles or updates to fields on existing profiles. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration Implementation Technique : REST API Integration Frequency : Batch Integration Resulting Data : User Profile s and User Field s and Raw Event Data This integration ingests data from your Snowflake account by directly querying the table or view selected during configuration. Once started, the job will: Run a query to select and order the rows that have yet to be imported. If the import is continuous, the job will save the timestamp of the last row seen, only the most recent data will be imported during future importa. Once the query completes, the result set will be imported in batches, starting from the oldest row. Once the last row is imported, if the job is configured to run continuously, it will sleep until the next run. The time between runs can be selected during configuration. Fields Fields imported through Snowflake will require custom data mapping. For assistance mapping your custom data to Lytics user fields, please contact Lytics Support . Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an import of Snowflake data in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see the Data Sources documentation for more information. Select Snowflake from the list of providers. Select the Import Audiences and Activity Data job type from the list. Select the Authorization you would like to use or create a new one . Enter a Label to identify this job you are creating in Lytics. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your job. Complete the configuration steps for your job. Using the Database dropdown menu, select the database you would like to import data from. Using the Source Type dropdown menu, select whether to import from a Snowflake table or view. Using the Source dropdown menu, select the table or view you want to import. In the Modified Timestamp Field text input, enter the name of the field containing the event timestamp. On continuous imports, the most recent time in this field will be saved. On the next import, only rows with a timestamp later than that value will be imported. Enter name of the Lytics Stream where the data will be imported. (optional) Select the Keep Updated checkbox to import table or view continuously. (optional) From the Frequency input, select the frequency at which to run the import. (Optional) Toggle Show Advanced Options . (optional) From the Event Timestamp Field input, select enter a timestamp field to use as the event timestamp in Lytics. If none is entered, Modified Timestamp Field will be used. (optional) In the Events Since text box, enter enter the earliest date from which to import events. Only events that occurred after this date will be imported. RFC3339 formatted (i.e. YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+00:00 ). Click the Start Import button. Bulk Audience Export Export user profiles including user fields and audience memberships from Lytics to Snowflake. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration Implementation Technique : File Based Transfer Integration Frequency : Batch Integration every 24 hours. Each batch contains the entire audience, and replaces the previous table. Resulting data : User Field s will be exported to Snowflake as rows in a Snowflake table. The resulting Snowflake schema is determined automatically by the workflow and will consist of the following Snowflake types according to the field's type in Lytics: BOOLEAN VARCHAR(16777216) NUMBER(38,0) FLOAT TIMESTAMP_TZ(9) VARIANT (used for non-scalar fields) When a job is started, the workflow will: Create a temporary table in Snowflake with the appropriate schema of the form USERS_{audience_slug}_{unix_timestamp} . Scan the audience for export, and load in CSV format to the Lytics-managed GCS storage integration for your account (see setup instructions below ). Load the data from GCS to your Snowflake account via COPY INTO . Once the load is complete, the temporary table will be renamed to a permanent table of the form USERS_{audience_slug} . NOTE : if a table of this name already exists in the target Snowflake schema with an identical schema to the temporary table, it will be dropped and replaced. If the schemas differ, the permanent table name will include an incremental suffix i.e. USERS_{audience_slug}1 . If the export is configured to run continuously, the workflow will sleep for 24 hours before repeating steps 1 through 4. Fields If fields are selected during job configuration, only those fields will be included in the resulting Snowflake table. If no fields are selected, all fields on the profile will be exported. Required Snowflake Setup Exporting to Snowflake requires additional configuration in your Snowflake account. You will need to create a storage integration in your Snowflake account that references a Lytics-owned GCS bucket. You will then need to retrieve the GCS service account associated with your storage integration in order to authorize in Lytics. More information about creating GCS storage integrations can be found here . Note that step 3 in the Snowflake docs linked is not necessary, as the GCS bucket is owned and managed by Lytics. In your Snowflake account, run the following queries to set up a storage integration for Lytics. Note : you will need ACCOUNTADMIN permissions to run the following queries. First, create your storage integration: create storage integration GCS_INT_LYTICS\n  type = external_stage\n  storage_provider = gcs\n  enabled = true\n  storage_allowed_locations = ('gcs://aid-{your-aid}-snowflake-exports-lyticsio/') Note that you will need to replace {your-aid} with the AID for your Lytics account in the query above. If you don't know your AID, contact your account manager for assistance. Second, retrieve your storage integration service account, you will need this to authorize the workflow: desc storage integration GCS_INT_LYTICS Finally, you will need to grant the role you authorized with permissions to use the newly created storage integration: grant usage on integration GCS_INT_LYTICS to role {your-role} Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an export job for Snowflake in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see the Destinations documentation for more information. Select Snowflake from the list of providers. Select the Bulk Export job type from the list. Select the authorization you would like to use or create a new one . Enter a Label to identify this job you are creating in Lytics. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your job. Select the audience to export. Complete the configuration steps for your job. Using the Database dropdown menu, select the database you would like to import data from. From the Schema input, select the name of the schema to export to. (Optional) From the Export Fields input, choose a list of fields to export. If none are selected, all fields on the profile will be included. (Optional) Select the Keep Updated checkbox to export the audience continuously. (Optional) From the Time of Day input, select the time of day to start continuous exports. (Optional) From the Timezone input, select a timezone for time of day. Click Start Export .

      "Fields If fields are selected during job configuration, only those fields will be included in the resulting Snowflake table. If no fields are selected, all fields on the profile will be exported. Required Snowflake Setup Exporting to Snowflake requires additional configuration in your Snowflake account. You will need to create a storage integration in your Snowflake account that references a Lytics-owned GCS bucket. You will then need to retrieve the GCS service account associated with your storage integration in order to authorize in Lytics. More information about creating GCS storage integrations can be found here . Note that step 3 in the Snowflake docs linked is not necessary, as the GCS bucket is owned and managed by Lytics. In your Snowflake account, run the following queries to set up a storage integration for Lytics. Note : you will need ACCOUNTADMIN permissions to run the following queries. First, create your storage integration: create storage integration GCS_INT_LYTICS\n  type = external_stage\n  storage_provider = gcs\n  enabled = true\n  storage_allowed_locations = ('gcs://aid-{your-aid}-snowflake-exports-lyticsio/') Note that you will need to replace {your-aid} with the AID for your Lytics account in the query above. If you don't know your AID, contact your account manager for assistance. Second, retrieve your storage integration service account, you will need this to authorize the workflow: desc storage integration GCS_INT_LYTICS Finally, you will need to grant the role you authorized with permissions to use the newly created storage integration: grant usage on integration GCS_INT_LYTICS to role {your-role} Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an export job for Snowflake in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see the Destinations documentation for more information. Select Snowflake from the list of providers. Select the Bulk Export job type from the list. Select the authorization you would like to use or create a new one . Enter a Label to identify this job you are creating in Lytics. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your job. Select the audience to export. Complete the configuration steps for your job. Using the Database dropdown menu, select the database you would like to import data from. From the Schema input, select the name of the schema to export to. (Optional) From the Export Fields input, choose a list of fields to export. If none are selected, all fields on the profile will be included. (Optional) Select the Keep Updated checkbox to export the audience continuously. (Optional) From the Time of Day input, select the time of day to start continuous exports. (Optional) From the Timezone input, select a timezone for time of day. Click Start Export .

    "title": "Identity Resolution",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Introduction Identity Resolution is a crucial component of customer communication. Establishing and maintaining a well-defined identity resolution strategy is essential, but it can be overwhelming to get started. Several challenges may arise, such as limited and outdated customer data, data silos, technical difficulties, in-flexibility, consistency, compliance, and maintenance. Lytics offers a solution that powers brands' identity resolution strategies by aggregating data from disparate sources, defining a standardized customer schema, unifying disparate sources, surfacing individual consumer profiles, enabling better understanding, segmentation, and activation across channel tools, ensuring control, visibility, flexibility, security, privacy, and compliance, and maximizing match rates and accuracy across activation channels. The goal is to construct complex consumer profiles and maintain accurate and compliant user profiles as your brand evolves. Defining the relationship between consumer identifiers is a necessary first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To achieve this, we've broken our approach into three components: Our Approach Define: Relationships Between Identifiers Profile definition is the first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To build a strong identity resolution strategy, three key questions must be answered: How important is accuracy? How do you define and manage the strength of each identifier to ensure profiles are materialized properly? How can the materialized profiles be analyzed and delivered to other tools? Construct: Complex Profiles Data is messy. Lytics' Profile Materialization provides a necessary cleansing & polishing layer atop the defined resolution strategy. This ensures what is surfaced is accurate and accessible and enables your team to accelerate impact. Answering the following two key questions guarantee profiles represent the ideal marketable entity: What attributes should be surfaced on profiles for segmentation, and does the data need to be normalized at all? What rules should be used to maintain profile integrity? Maintain: Accurate & Compliant Profiles Over time profiles will bloat, attributes will become stale, and use cases become more complex. If unmanaged, a quality identity strategy will begin breaking down the moment it is implemented. Lytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile health-related questions have concrete answers: How can you validate the health of your ID resolution strategy over time? What is the process for managing consent? How long is a profile relevant if it no longer has a means of being updated? What is the life expectancy of expirable IDs, such as browser cookies? Advanced Concepts The Lytics Identity Graph Behind each Lytics profile is an identity graph.  This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source. To create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or more identity keys that identify distinct users with which to associate the data.  When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called an identity fragment .  When there's evidence on a data stream  that two keys or fragments should be connected When evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph.  Some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data. In contrast, other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction, like an anonymous cookie from a single-visit, incognito browser. Graph Mechanics As you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments.  Many profiles start as singletons – new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment. However, we're not satisfied with several singletons – our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments.  Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event.  A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tickets, CRM data, etc. In graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments.  If we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address, we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments.  From there, we'd want to find all of the connections to those other fragments, and so on, until there are no more connections to follow.  Following one fragment to another is called traversal .  The full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are called neighbors . In Lytics, default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50.  Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly.  To change these values for your data, please contact Lytics support . Identity Keys As we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution. For example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys.  Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.).  Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses.  Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated with many email addresses. Field Types Field types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set.  String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time.  Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry.  Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (personal, work, etc.).  In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball. Using an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type.  A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values.  On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values. Identity Key Rankings The ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy.  In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win.  Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers. Imagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z.  If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have a conflict , meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with two different email fragments and violates our merge rules. The ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new event, the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for Email A and not the profile for Email B. Graph Compaction We mentioned that a critical tenet of bulletproof identity resolution is that profile complexity remains stable over time.  That is, we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesn't result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts. In Lytics, that is accomplished via graph compaction, a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment.  Doing so allows well-established relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile.  It functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragments tidy. Compaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms. Rank-based Compaction Let's go back to our example with Email A and Email B.  The point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers.  The longer that Email A and Email B represent profiles in the platform, the more cookies with which they'll eventually become connected.  Each identity key's ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time. Size compaction : Identity key sets can be compacted after they reach a configurable size.  If size compaction is enabled to compact a set after 30 values, then the data from the oldest 30 fragments would be combined into a single fragment and would be further compacted with new data as new values are observed. Time compaction : These sets would be compacted after a configurable time threshold.  If time compaction is enabled to compact a set after 14 days, then the data from fragments older than 14 days would be compacted into a single fragment. Updated over 1 year ago",

      "Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly.  To change these values for your data, please contact Lytics support . Identity Keys As we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution. For example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys.  Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.).  Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses.  Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated with many email addresses. Field Types Field types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set.  String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time.  Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry.  Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (personal, work, etc.).  In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball. Using an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type.  A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values.  On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values. Identity Key Rankings The ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy.  In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win.  Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers. Imagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z.  If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have a conflict , meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with two different email fragments and violates our merge rules. The ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new event, the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for Email A and not the profile for Email B. Graph Compaction We mentioned that a critical tenet of bulletproof identity resolution is that profile complexity remains stable over time.  That is, we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesn't result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts. In Lytics, that is accomplished via graph compaction, a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment.  Doing so allows well-established relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile.  It functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragments tidy. Compaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms. Rank-based Compaction Let's go back to our example with Email A and Email B.  The point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers.  The longer that Email A and Email B represent profiles in the platform, the more cookies with which they'll eventually become connected.  Each identity key's ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time. Size compaction : Identity key sets can be compacted after they reach a configurable size.  If size compaction is enabled to compact a set after 30 values, then the data from the oldest 30 fragments would be combined into a single fragment and would be further compacted with new data as new values are observed. Time compaction : These sets would be compacted after a configurable time threshold.  If time compaction is enabled to compact a set after 14 days, then the data from fragments older than 14 days would be compacted into a single fragment. Updated over 1 year ago"

    "content": "Access Cloud Connect tabs are found under Data Pipeline > Cloud Connect . Connections configure the access to your data warehouses, and Data Models configure the SQL queries that are run to connect audience membership and profile attributes. Creating a Connection Click + Create New Connection from the Connections Dashboard at the top right and complete the following steps. Choose the provider. Choose the Connection type. Select an existing Authorization or create a new one by following the Authorization instructions . Add a name (label), description, and complete the configuration options. These will vary slightly between providers. Authorization & Security The authorization selected for your Connection will control your Lytics account users' access to your data warehouse. You can control whether a user has read access to the entire dataset or individual tables, maintaining your security and governance practices within your data warehouse. Supported Data Warehouses Cloud Connect currently supports a number of popular data warehouses: Amazon Redshift Databricks Google BigQuery Microsoft Azure SQL Database Snowflake Managing Connections Once you have created a Connection, you can access a summary page showing how data from your data warehouse is being leveraged in Lytics. At the top of the page, you’ll see the following information: Provider : Data warehouse that you are connecting with Lytics. Authorization : Name of the authorization, such as “Cloud Connect JWT.” Note: Lytics users can access any data tables that the Connection Authorization has read access to. Type : Indicates the type based on your provider. Created By : Lytics user who created the Connection. Created On : Date the Connection was initially created. Last Updated : Date the Connection was most recently edited. The rest of the Summary tab shows how many active and inactive data models are built using this Connection as a data source and how many tables are accessible from this dataset. The Activity chart displays how many rows are being queried, which can have cost implications based on your data warehouse usage. Explore The Explore tab provides a simple Schema Explorer to validate that the data shown is as you would expect to see in your data warehouse. In the example below, we only connected an individual table, but here you will see as many tables as the authorization has read access to. Details The Details section displays all the information about setting up your Connection, including the authorization and configuration settings. Logs The Logs section records the history of events for this Connection, which are helpful to ensure your connection is working as expected. Below are the connection event types you may see. Connection Events Description Created First event indicating the Connection is active. Updated Connection was updated by a Lytics user. Deleted Connection was removed and any data models built on this Connection will no longer be updated. Updated 3 months ago",

    "title": "Client & Server Side Cookies",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "What is a Cookie An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol. Cookie Flavors First-party First-party cookies are created by the host domain – the domain the user is visiting. These cookies are generally considered good; they help provide a better user experience and keep the session open. This means the browser can remember key information, such as items you add to shopping carts, username, and language preferences. Third-party Third-party cookies are those created by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time and are mainly used for tracking and online-advertising purposes. They also allow website owners to provide certain services, such as live chats. Common Cookie Use Cases Session management Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember. Personalization User preferences, themes, and other settings. Tracking Recording and analyzing user behavior. How does Lytics use cookies? Cookies are one of the preferred methods for maintaining a user identifier in the browser, both known and anonymous. This gets associated with all inbound events captured by our Javascript tag as they interact with customer websites. Specifically, our Javascript tag stores a string of digits and characters that are used as a unique ID commonly referred to as our _uid or, in some cases seerid as a first-party cookie. Creating & Managing Cookies Where do cookies come from? Client-Side In web development, the client-side refers to everything in a web application displayed on the client (end-user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions an application performs within the user's browser. When someone refers to a “client-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and/or managed via a common client-side programming language such as Javascript. Server Side Like with client-side, server-side means everything that happens on the server instead of on the client. In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server-side, including rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications. When someone refers to a “server-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and managed using one of the many common server-side programming languages such as NodeJS, PHP, Python, etc. Cookie Ingredients Name Defines the cookie name. Generally, the cookie name is the primary way of retrieving a cookie and its associated value and attributes. Value The stored value for the cookie. This can include any US-ASCII character excluding a control character, whitespace, double quotes, comma, semicolon, and backslash. Expires Indicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. See Date for the required formatting. Max-Age Indicates the number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately. Domain Defines the host to which the cookie will be sent. Path Indicates the path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send the Cookie header. Secure This indicates that the cookie is sent to the server only when a request is made with the HTTPS: scheme (except on localhost) and, therefore, is more resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks . HttpOnly Forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie, for example, through the Document.cookie property. Note that a cookie created with HttpOnly will still be sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, for example, when calling XMLHttpRequest.send() or fetch() . This mitigates attacks against cross-site scripting ( XSS ). SameSite Controls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks ( CSRF ). Who’s taking away my cookies?!? In June 2017, Apple introduced a new privacy feature called Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) . This same feature was officially released in September 2017 with Safari 12 and iOS 11. Since then, the ITP has evolved and introduced several subsequent versions leading us to the current state (as of July 2022), which has many impacts on marketing but most notably: ITP blocks all third-party cookies by default. (ITP 1.0/1.1) ITP can grant exceptions to third-party cookies with Storage API. (ITP 2.0) ITP caps all first-party cookies set with JavaScript to 7 days or 24 hours. (ITP 2.1/2.2) ITP caps first-party cookies set by the server using CNAME cloaking to 7 days. (ITP 2.3) As a result of the privacy and security efforts in general other browsers such as Mozilla’s Firefox(ETP) and Google Chrome have followed suit in announcing and/or implementing their security and tracking protocols, which continue to impact tools such as third and first-party cookies that have long been a staple in providing the data necessary for marketers to personalize their communications effectively. What can I do to replace my cookies? With each iteration on more stringent privacy-related changes comes a wave of workarounds or alternate approaches to maintaining access to behavioral data essential to marketing: 1. Deploy a strong first-party identification strategy. There is no replacement then a strong identification strategy. Creating a relationship in which a user will openly share their identity through a login or some other authenticated means will always result in the highest level of certainty on identity, which leads to the best level of personalization. However, many use cases focus on anonymous users or users who have not built up the relationship necessary to unlock this level of authentication. 2. First-party client-side cookies have changed but are still a viable solution. Though third-party cookies are effectively dead, first-party cookies are still viable for many use cases. Not only do they offer a very simple off-the-shelf type of implementation for leveraging, they also have a long shelf life, assuming that an anonymous user interacts frequently enough to overcome the 7-day expiration window. 3. First-party server-side cookies offer an extended expiration window. Over the past 12 months, there has been a surge of interest in server-side cookies. This method for setting cookies currently is not affected by the ITP changes that impact client-side cookies, most notably the automatic expiration at seven days. Rather, server-side cookies can live for long periods, leading to a higher quality identification for anonymous users. The downside, however, is they are far more difficult to leverage than the client-side. They require a much more technical integration with whatever server-side technology is used to power the web asset and may not be accessible in the same manner as client-side cookies. Getting Technical with Server Side Cookies In general, regardless of the specific attribute settings used when leveraging server-side cookies, they currently are not impacted by the 7-day expiration window that client-side cookies fall victim to. However, Apple has made it clear that they have additional plans to extend some of the client-side cookie limitations to the server-side, and the most important attribute in that discussion is the HttpOnly attribute. https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/ As a CDP and technology leader, we always aim to help our customers future-proof their implementations. As such, even though a non-HttpOnly server-side cookie offers an easier means to bypass current client-side restrictions, it is our recommendation to consider investing to leverage HttpOnly cookies set by the server-side to prevent any potential impacts of the next few iterations of ITP. Below we’ll explore the two options and demonstrate the key differences. Server Side Cookie without HttpOnly The following example in Node.js demonstrates a sample snippet for setting the cookie server side. Most server-side languages have existing methods to make this very easy. In the case of creating a cookie for Lytics to leverage, you will also need to generate a unique ID which can be done in a variety of ways. In the case of Node, you may consider using the randomUUID() method of the Crypto interface . A simple Google search can lead you or your developer down the road of generating a unique ID that best fits your use case. Once you have that unique ID, you simply set the cookie using the pre-defined Lytics name our Javascript tag is looking for. Alternatively, the tag can be configured to use any custom name. // THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS A UNTESTED AND NON-PRODUCTION LEVEL\n// EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SET A COOKIE SERVER SIDE WITH NODE.JS AND\n// ACCESS THE DOCUMENT.COOKIES FROM THE CLIENT SIDE\n\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\nvar cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar dayjs = require('dayjs');\n\n// cookieParser middleware\napp.use(cookieParser());\n\n// route for setting the cookies\napp.get('/setcookie', function (req, res) {\n  // setting a server side cookie without httponly\n  res.cookie(\"seerid\", crypto.randomUUID(), {\n    httpOnly: false,\n    expires: dayjs().add(30, \"days\").toDate(),\n  });\n\n  res.send(`<html><body><p>A server side cookie has been set.</p></body></html>`);\n})\n\n// Route for getting all the cookies\napp.get('/getcookie', function (req, res) {\n    res.send(`\n        <html>\n            <head>\n                <script>\n                    alert(document.cookie);\n                </script>\n            </head>\n            <body>\n                <p>This is an example of how to get the cookies client side.</p>\n            </body>\n        </html>`\n    );\n})\n\napp.listen(3000, (err) => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('server running on port 3000');\n}); Since non-HttpOnly cookies are accessible out of the box client-side there is no additional lift necessary. Our tag will pick up the cookie and use that ID as the identifier. It is important to note that any UID changes must also be managed server-side as setting the cookie client-side will engage the 7-day expiration max. In this example, we simply raise an alert with the cookie string and do not show the actual implementation of the Lytics tag. Server Side Cookie with HttpOnly Setting HttpOnly to true comes with an additional level of complexity but benefits from following the stringent and recommended guidelines of Apple ITP, which in theory will go farther in the way of future-proofing. Much like the above example, we’ll set a cookie, in this case using Node, in the same way. The only difference here is setting httpOnly to true. This means that the cookie is secure but will no longer be accessible out of the box by Javascript. Rather, you’ll have to implement an alternative method for surfacing that ID to Javascript so that it can be passed to the Lytics Javascript tag and used during collection/resolution. // THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS A UNTESTED AND NON-PRODUCTION LEVEL\n// EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SET A COOKIE SERVER SIDE WITH NODE.JS AND\n// ACCESS THE DOCUMENT.COOKIES FROM THE CLIENT SIDE WHEN USING HTTPONLY\n\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\nvar cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar dayjs = require('dayjs');\n\n// cookieParser middleware\napp.use(cookieParser());\n\n// route for setting the cookies\napp.get('/setcookie', function (req, res) {\n  // setting a server side cookie with httponly\n  res.cookie(\"uuid\", crypto.randomUUID(), {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    expires: dayjs().add(30, \"days\").toDate(),\n  });\n\n  res.send(`<html><body><p>A server side cookie has been set using httpOnly.</p></body></html>`);\n})\n\n// Route for getting all the cookies\napp.get('/getcookie', function (req, res) {\n    res.send(`\n        <html>\n            <head>\n                <script>\n                    var uuid = '${req.cookies.uuid}';\n                    alert(uuid);\n                </script>\n            </head>\n            <body>\n                <p>This is an example of how to get the cookies client side when cookie is httpOnly.</p>\n            </body>\n        </html>`\n    );\n})\n\napp.listen(3000, (err) => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('server running on port 3000');\n}); All code examples in this document are purely for demonstration.

      "Since then, the ITP has evolved and introduced several subsequent versions leading us to the current state (as of July 2022), which has many impacts on marketing but most notably: ITP blocks all third-party cookies by default. (ITP",
      "Deploy a strong first-party identification strategy. There is no replacement then a strong identification strategy. Creating a relationship in which a user will openly share their identity through a login or some other authenticated means will always result in the highest level of certainty on identity, which leads to the best level of personalization. However, many use cases focus on anonymous users or users who have not built up the relationship necessary to unlock this level of authentication.",
      "First-party client-side cookies have changed but are still a viable solution. Though third-party cookies are effectively dead, first-party cookies are still viable for many use cases. Not only do they offer a very simple off-the-shelf type of implementation for leveraging, they also have a long shelf life, assuming that an anonymous user interacts frequently enough to overcome the 7-day expiration window.",
      "First-party server-side cookies offer an extended expiration window. Over the past 12 months, there has been a surge of interest in server-side cookies. This method for setting cookies currently is not affected by the ITP changes that impact client-side cookies, most notably the automatic expiration at seven days. Rather, server-side cookies can live for long periods, leading to a higher quality identification for anonymous users. The downside, however, is they are far more difficult to leverage than the client-side. They require a much more technical integration with whatever server-side technology is used to power the web asset and may not be accessible in the same manner as client-side cookies. Getting Technical with Server Side Cookies In general, regardless of the specific attribute settings used when leveraging server-side cookies, they currently are not impacted by the 7-day expiration window that client-side cookies fall victim to. However, Apple has made it clear that they have additional plans to extend some of the client-side cookie limitations to the server-side, and the most important attribute in that discussion is the HttpOnly attribute. https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/ As a CDP and technology leader, we always aim to help our customers future-proof their implementations. As such, even though a non-HttpOnly server-side cookie offers an easier means to bypass current client-side restrictions, it is our recommendation to consider investing to leverage HttpOnly cookies set by the server-side to prevent any potential impacts of the next few iterations of ITP. Below we’ll explore the two options and demonstrate the key differences. Server Side Cookie without HttpOnly The following example in Node.js demonstrates a sample snippet for setting the cookie server side. Most server-side languages have existing methods to make this very easy. In the case of creating a cookie for Lytics to leverage, you will also need to generate a unique ID which can be done in a variety of ways. In the case of Node, you may consider using the randomUUID() method of the Crypto interface . A simple Google search can lead you or your developer down the road of generating a unique ID that best fits your use case. Once you have that unique ID, you simply set the cookie using the pre-defined Lytics name our Javascript tag is looking for. Alternatively, the tag can be configured to use any custom name. // THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS A UNTESTED AND NON-PRODUCTION LEVEL\n// EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SET A COOKIE SERVER SIDE WITH NODE.JS AND\n// ACCESS THE DOCUMENT.COOKIES FROM THE CLIENT SIDE\n\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\nvar cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar dayjs = require('dayjs');\n\n// cookieParser middleware\napp.use(cookieParser());\n\n// route for setting the cookies\napp.get('/setcookie', function (req, res) {\n  // setting a server side cookie without httponly\n  res.cookie(\"seerid\", crypto.randomUUID(), {\n    httpOnly: false,\n    expires: dayjs().add(30, \"days\").toDate(),\n  });\n\n  res.send(`<html><body><p>A server side cookie has been set.</p></body></html>`);\n})\n\n// Route for getting all the cookies\napp.get('/getcookie', function (req, res) {\n    res.send(`\n        <html>\n            <head>\n                <script>\n                    alert(document.cookie);\n                </script>\n            </head>\n            <body>\n                <p>This is an example of how to get the cookies client side.</p>\n            </body>\n        </html>`\n    );\n})\n\napp.listen(3000, (err) => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('server running on port 3000');\n}); Since non-HttpOnly cookies are accessible out of the box client-side there is no additional lift necessary. Our tag will pick up the cookie and use that ID as the identifier. It is important to note that any UID changes must also be managed server-side as setting the cookie client-side will engage the 7-day expiration max. In this example, we simply raise an alert with the cookie string and do not show the actual implementation of the Lytics tag. Server Side Cookie with HttpOnly Setting HttpOnly to true comes with an additional level of complexity but benefits from following the stringent and recommended guidelines of Apple ITP, which in theory will go farther in the way of future-proofing. Much like the above example, we’ll set a cookie, in this case using Node, in the same way. The only difference here is setting httpOnly to true. This means that the cookie is secure but will no longer be accessible out of the box by Javascript. Rather, you’ll have to implement an alternative method for surfacing that ID to Javascript so that it can be passed to the Lytics Javascript tag and used during collection/resolution. // THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS A UNTESTED AND NON-PRODUCTION LEVEL\n// EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SET A COOKIE SERVER SIDE WITH NODE.JS AND\n// ACCESS THE DOCUMENT.COOKIES FROM THE CLIENT SIDE WHEN USING HTTPONLY\n\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\nvar cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar dayjs = require('dayjs');\n\n// cookieParser middleware\napp.use(cookieParser());\n\n// route for setting the cookies\napp.get('/setcookie', function (req, res) {\n  // setting a server side cookie with httponly\n  res.cookie(\"uuid\", crypto.randomUUID(), {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    expires: dayjs().add(30, \"days\").toDate(),\n  });\n\n  res.send(`<html><body><p>A server side cookie has been set using httpOnly.</p></body></html>`);\n})\n\n// Route for getting all the cookies\napp.get('/getcookie', function (req, res) {\n    res.send(`\n        <html>\n            <head>\n                <script>\n                    var uuid = '${req.cookies.uuid}';\n                    alert(uuid);\n                </script>\n            </head>\n            <body>\n                <p>This is an example of how to get the cookies client side when cookie is httpOnly.</p>\n            </body>\n        </html>`\n    );\n})\n\napp.listen(3000, (err) => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('server running on port 3000');\n}); All code examples in this document are purely for demonstration.

    "content": "Cloud Connect Data Models A Data Model is used by Cloud Connect to link or \"connect\" a user's external data warehouse to Lytics profiles. Each Data Model represents a set of records defined by a SQL query. Each Data Model will also configure a join key which defines how the Data Model is joined to Lytics Profiles. Once a Connection to your data warehouse has been created, Data Models can be created via the Data Models tab within the navigation bar: Creating a Data Model Click + Create New from the Data Models dashboard and complete the following steps. Select the Connection. Write the SQL query. Query Editor : Write and test standard SQL queries directly in Lytics. Alternatively, copy and paste queries you've tested in your BigQuery or Snowflake instance. When you click Test Query , Lytics will return 10 sample records. Test the query and validate the results. Configure the Data Model. Name : Data Model name Description : The Description of the Data Model. Slug : The Data Model name that will be used in the membership and activation fields in the audience builder. It is important that the name chosen here makes sense for those building audiences in the tool. If no slug is selected, it will auto-populate using the model name. Primary Key : Select the data warehouse ID that will be used to match against profiles in Lytics. External Lytics Key : Select a Lytics user profile field that is a unique identifier to map to an identifier in your incoming data source. Activated Fields :Select the fields you want to bring into Lytics profiles for activation. Note that each data model can only include 25 columns as activated fields. Sync Frequency : Select a time interval to run the query on - this is also the frequency that your Lytics profiles will be updated. The beta options are currently every 1 hour to every 3 weeks. Create new Lytics profile : Check this box if you want to create new profiles in Lytics if a profile with a matching ID does not already exist in Lytics. If you do not select this check box, only users with matching IDs to the Data Model IDs will be updated. Activate the Model. Until the Data Model is activated, its SQL query will not be run against your data warehouse and Lytics profiles will not be updated with the selected fields. 📘 When building multiple Cloud Connect Data Models with the same primary key, you must select the same External Lytics Key mapping. Selecting a different Lytics key will result in an error when you try to save the new Data Model. Example Use Case Consider this scenario to demonstrate why you'd want to create a Cloud Connect Data Model driven audience instead of a standard Lytics audience. Your company sells e-bikes and wants to run a holiday campaign that sends a promotion to any customer who purchased an e-bike in November or December last year. Perhaps you also want to refine your audience to those who are interested in particular bike brands. All of this purchase and product data already exists in your Google BigQuery instance (as shown below). Instead of directly importing all that purchase history data into Lytics, you can write a SQL query to find which customers meet this audience criteria. By copying this query directly into the Lytics Model Builder (as shown in the generate a query screenshot above), you'll create a new audience in Lytics that will be updated on the frequency interval you decide. Once the Data Model is activated, profiles will be updated with a membership field that can be used to create an audience. Activated fields can be added to the Data Model that can then be used for more dynamic audiences. SQL Translator If you would like to skip having to write a SQL query, simply describe the Data Model of what you wish to fetch and using GenAI, Lytics will translate the description to a SQL query for you. Lytics makes queries to your database to ensure that the data is up to date and accurate when creating the query. Updated 22 days ago",

With our Integration Options we enable flexibility across the various channels where your data exists and tools to build customized integrations. Lytics Integration Options include: Webhooks Lytics File Service integrations for server-to-server file transfer Javascript Tag Mobile SDK Data Warehouse Integrations Read on for details on each option. If you have questions about any of these options or would like to further explore an integration with a specific platform reach out to your Lytics contact. Webhooks Webhooks offer one of the simplest and most flexible options for enabling applications to share data. They’re broadly used in the cloud computing world for integrations that can be stood up quickly with a minimal amount of code. The Lytics Webhook integration supports triggered delivery of audience membership (enters and exits) to a destination url where another application can pick it up. See our Webhook documentation for full details. Interested to understand how a Webhook integration might be applied? Look at this Mobile Messaging use case for a simple Lytics Webhook integration to support one-to-one personalized messaging with Twilio. Server-to-Server File Transfer Server-to-server file transfer is a very common mechanism for data sharing. Lytics File Service options enable Lytics to pull or push user data from an SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) using a CSV (comma-separated values) or JSON file. If you have another platform that also enables integrations via SFTP, this integration path helps to automate the process of passing data between your system and Lytics. Check out the Lytics File Service documentation to learn about setting up the file transfer job. In addition to SFTP, Amazon S3 is a very commonly used medium for server-to-server file transfer. Refer to our Amazon S3 documentation for data import and export options. Javascript Layer/JS Tag The Lytics JS Tag is the default option for client-side (website) data sharing with Lytics. The JS Tag supports the delivery of user behavior attributes from your website into Lytics and can also return back to the website user profile data such as audience members or content recommendations from Lytics for real time personalization. Refer to our JS Tag Documentation for full details. Mobile SDK The Lytics Mobile SDK facilitates in-app data sharing with iOS and Android. Similar to the JS Tag, the Mobile SDK supports user behavior-based data delivery to Lytics and profile data to the app for real-time personalization. See our Mobile SDK Documentation for more details. Using Your Data Warehouse If you already use a data warehouse to manage your data this is a great option for data import and export with Lytics. Lytics integrates with Google Big Query Amazon Redshift Microsoft Azure Snowflake Databricks Each of these providers offers options for importing data into databases which can then be imported into Lytics using Cloud Connect or our Data Import integrations. Lytics can also export data into each of these data warehouses. Updated 9 months ago",

    "content": "Overview Acoustic (previously known as Silverpop) is a marketing platform that enables email, SMS, and mobile campaigns, among other marketing analytics and automation solutions. Integrating Lytics with Acoustic allows you to import users and their activity data to build behavioral audiences and gain Insights in Lytics. You can then export Lytics audiences back to Acoustic to refine your targeting and deliver personalized messaging. Authorization If you have not done so already, you will need to set up an Acoustic account before you begin the process described below. Your Acoustic account user must have permission to create Application Access via the API. Select Acoustic from the list of providers. Select the Full Auth method for authorization. Enter a Label to identify your authorization. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your authorization. Enter your Client ID for the application that you have created in your Acoustic account. For more information, please refer to Acoustic Documentation . Enter the Client Secret for your entered Client ID. Enter the Pod number of your Acoustic Campaign. You can find the Pod information in Account Setting page of your Acoustic account. For example, if it is Pod 2 then just enter 2 . Enter Refresh Token that you have created to grant Lytics access. For more information, please refer to Acoustic Documentation . Enter your SFTP Username for the Acoustic Account. Enter your SFTP Password for the above SFTP User. You can use your own credentials here, or create a new user for this integration. Click Save Authorization . 📘 For this integration, it is recommended to create a new Acoustic User specific for Lytics with the option Do not enforce password expiration policies for this user selected so the authentication is long lasting, and can be revoked on an account by account basis. Import Audiences & Activity Import Acoustic users and their activity information into Lytics so you can leverage that data to build behavioral audiences and gain Insights powered by Lytics data science. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : XML API Integration to download CSV formatted data. Frequency :  Data is imported as a Batch Integration ; imported once, or every 8 hours on a continuous basis. Resulting Data : Full Lytics user profiles for all Acoustic users complete with activity data. This integration utilizes the Acoustic XML API to import Acoustic users and their activity to Lytics. Each run of the job will proceed as follows: Exports users from the selected Acoustic Database as a CSV file to an Acoustic-manged SFTP server. The CSV files are then read and imported to the silverpop_users stream in Lytics. Exports email activity from users in the selected Acoustic Database as a CSV file to an Acoustic-manged SFTP server. The CSV files are then read and imported to the silverpop_activity stream in Lytics. After successful completion, the job will import new/updated users with their updated activity every 8 hours if configured to run continuously. Fields The following fields are included in the default mapping for the silverpop_users stream. Note this integration was formerly named Silverpop, hence the data stream name, but this job will receive your current Acoustic data.

    "content": "Overview Lytics File Service allows you to import or export data from sources that Lytics does not have a built-in integration with. Data can imported in either a JSON or CSV file and exported as a CSV file for use in ads or campaign targeting. Authorization Lytics uses SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to import files into Lytics and to export user data into files on an SFTP server. You can use your own SFTP service or Lytics can provide a managed SFTP server account. Adding an authorization for use in an import or export job differs if you use our own or a Lytics SFTP account. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see the Authorizations Dashboard documentation for more information. Select Lytics File Service from the list of providers. Select the method for authorization. Note that different methods may support different job types. Custom supports the following authorization methods: Client SFTP Server Authorization Client SFTP Server Authorization with PGP Private Key Client SFTP Server Authorization with PGP Public Key Lytics Managed SFTP Server Authorizations Enter a Label to identify your authorization.

Follow these steps to set up and configure an export job for Lytics File Service in the Lytics platform. Select Lytics File Service from the list of providers. Select the Export CSV via SFTP job type from the list. Select the Authorization you would like to use or create a new one . Enter a Label to identify this job you are creating in Lytics. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your job. From the Audience Name drop-down, select the Lytics audience that contains the users to export. (Optional) From the Compress input, select the compression type for the file to be exported. (Optional) Select the Include Headers checkbox, to include the field names as the first row of the exported file. (Optional) Select the Audience Name checkbox, to select to add a column with the name of the exported Lytics audience. (optional) Select the Audience Slug checkbox, to add a column with the slug of the exported Lytics audience. (Optional) Select the Additional Audiences checkbox, to add a column containing all the Lytics audiences a user is a member of. (Optional) From the Fields to Export input, select the list of user fields to export. If none are selected then every user field will be included. (Optional) In the User Limit numeric field, enter the maximum number of users to export. Leave blank to export all users. (Optional) In the Custom Delimiter text box, enter a custom delimiter for your file. Default delimiter is \",\". A recommended custom delimiter is \"|\" (pipe). (Optional) From the Custom Join input, select a custom join character for fields that have multiple values. Default is to join multi-value fields with \"&\", e.g., emails= [email protected] & [email protected] . (Optional) Select the Continuous Export checkbox, to export at the specified frequency selected in File Export Frequency option. (Optional) From the File Export Frequency input, select how often to export the new file. (Optional) From the Time of Day input, select time of day to start export each day. (Optional) From the Timezone input, select timezone for time of day. (Optional) From the Timestamp Format input, select the format for the timestamp that will be added at the end of the filename. MM = month, mm = minute. If None (omit timestamp) is selected, the file name will not contain a timestamp. For continuous exports, this will result in the file being overwritten on each run.

    "title": "Integration Patterns",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Overview Lytics offers pre-built integrations for many of today’s most popular marketing tools to ease the onboarding and exporting of data. These integrations are available in the Data tab of the Lytics platform under Data > Jobs . Each of these marketing tools has specific instructions for setup found in our integrations documentation. Types The implementation type refers to the development methods used to implement the job. Usually this depends on the third-party provider's capabilities and the resources they provide to outside developers such as APIs or SDKs. Integrations may be client-side or server-side. Client-side Integrations Client-side integrations are implemented in browser-facing code. These are implemented through the Lytics JavaScript tag and usually require you to have a tag from the third-party provider also installed on your web page. Given the nature of these integrations being tightly coupled to the browser session, these integrations collect and send data in real time. There are two types of client-side integrations: Push Integrations A push integration pushes data from Lytics, such as surfaced fields or audience membership of users to the third party. Examples of push integrations include personalization tools such as Pathfora SDK which uses Lytics user data to personalize the page with content based on audience membership, or data management platforms (DMPs) such as Krux, which transmits Lytics user information to the DMP. Pull Integrations A pull integration pulls data from the third party and imports it into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider, and the exact fields available in the audience builder will be listed in the respective integration document. An example of this type of integration includes the Lytics JavaScript tag communicating with a data layer object on your website to collect data from various third-party vendors such as Tealium or even a custom implementation. Server-to-server Integrations Server-side integrations allow Lytics and the third-party service to communicate directly, usually in the form of a job. These jobs are available to set up and execute in the Lytics platform under Data > Jobs . There are two main types of Server-side integrations: Import Integrations As the name implies, import integrations ingest data into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider and job type. It can be anything from identifying information, demographic data, subscription status, or activity data for a user. Examples of import integrations include the Amplitude Cohorts Import which imports user data from Amplitude. Export Integrations Export integrations send user profile data from Lytics to a third-party tool, usually at the audience level. You can select which audience(s) you want to export, and include user data such as user fields, audience membership and more such as the SendGrid User Export. However, some integrations may export raw event data or metrics for monitoring such as the BigQuery Event Export or the New Relic Insights Monitoring job. Enrichment Integrations An enrichment integration uses a third-party service to enhance and enrich existing user profiles within Lytics. These integrations require Lytics to push a list of user identifiers (defined by an audience of known users) to a third-party enrichment tool. That tool then returns additional data on that user such as information on the user's company (for B2B marketing), or additional demographic and social data. Examples of enrichment integrations include Full Contact Audience Enrichment and Clearbit User Enrichment jobs. Many providers support both import and export job types for a complete two-way data sync between Lytics and the third-party tool. Implementation Techniques Client and server-side integrations may be implemented in a number of different ways. The implementation technique often determines factors such as Tier, Frequency, and Resulting Data. Client-side Implementations JavaScript Tag All default client-side integrations somehow utilize the Lytics JavaScript tag. The tag implements functions for sending data to a data stream and receiving user profile data which has been surfaced. Behind the scenes, these functions utilize some of the public Lytics API endpoints. Server-side Implementations APIs API integrations utilize REST or SOAP APIs the third-party vendor provides to send or receive data. The specific endpoints used are listed in the documentation for the integration. Lytics prefers to integrate with third parties via API as it provides a deeper out-of-the-box integration. Audience Triggers Audience triggers are used in conjunction with an API implementation for export or enrichment job types. Audience triggers are powered by an internal system called subscriptions. Subscriptions listen to specific events, such as when a user has entered or exited an audience. A subscription can then send a trigger to any job listening to the subscription. Once received, the job can push the updated user data to the third-party tool via APIs. This process enables real-time exports versus a scheduled batch export. File-Based Transfer Lytics supports file-based import and export jobs. Files may be obtained or pushed to a server via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) . SFTP integrations may be provided for third-party vendors who do not have API capabilities or as part of a custom integration. Lytics has a managed SFTP server that can be used to transfer files, or it may retrieve files from a third-party SFTP server. Another example of a file-based export is via Email Attachment , such as the CSV Email Export. Webhooks Many third-party vendors offer webhooks or API callbacks, which send requests containing relevant user-activity data to another service after an event has occurred in the system. The Lytics API has a collection endpoint that can be used as a destination for third-party webhooks. Providers that support webhooks will have documentation detailing the preferred setup method for Lytics to receive webhook data. In addition, Lytics supports webhooks that can be configured to send user-level events, such as real-time audience membership updates. Frequency Frequency describes when and how often that data is sent or received. It attempts to answer common questions such as: \"When will I see data in my tool?\" and \"Can I keep my data up-to-date?\" Lytics integrations are either real-time or scheduled. Real-time A number of different integration types are considered real-time (or \"near\" real-time). In that, user data is sent or received downstream as soon as the data is available in the native system. The following types of integrations are considered real-time: Client-Side Integrations - All client-side integrations are considered real-time unless otherwise stated in the documentation. Data collected via a pull integration is captured in the browser while the user performs actions, and push integrations always contain the most up-to-date data from the user profile. Webhooks - As stated above, webhooks are API calls that happen after an event has occurred, often used to notify downstream tools. Jobs Using Triggers - As stated above, jobs utilizing triggers receive and may push events downstream in real-time. Depending on rate limits or other such limitations of the third-party in question, the job may queue a small batch of events over a short amount of time before sending them, hence \"near\" real-time. Backfill Jobs that use audience triggers also often have an option to perform a backfill of users. Without a backfill, only new users who enter the audience after the time of job setup will be processed. Enabling a one-time backfill as part of the job configuration will immediately process a batch of all existing users in the audience to the third-party tool and then rely on real-time triggers to update user information once the backfill is finished. Some jobs support this feature as a configurable option. If so, it is listed under the \"Frequency\" section of \"Integration Details\" in a job's documentation. Batch Batch integrations send or receive user data in larger batches. Depending on the configuration of the job, it may only import/export a single batch of users once, or it may run continuously, checking for new users and updates to existing user data. One-time run - You may want to run a one-time job to import, export, or enrich users at a specific point in time. For example, if you're running a one-time promotional blast email to a unique audience, exporting your audience once before sending the email would make sense. Continuous Update - Many batch jobs support a configuration option for continuous updates which will re-run the job on some cadence (hourly, daily, weekly, etc). This is common for import jobs for providers that don't support webhooks, as Lytics will want to keep the user profiles up to date with what is available in the third party. Scheduled - Some jobs may support specific scheduled run times, which can be especially helpful for continuous updates. It allows you to specify the time of day the job should run and the timezone. Resulting Data The final way Lytics categorizes integrations is by the type of data it handles and how the job output is perceived. The resulting export and push integration data will vary based on the structures supported by the provider tool, and each integration will document the specific output type. Here is a list of common data types in Lytics for import and pull integrations: User Profiles When you import users, you will likely see new user profiles created for users that previously did not have data associated with them in Lytics. However, you may also see updates to existing users' profiles, if Lytics is able to recognize an existing user based on the identity resolution strategy for your account. User Fields The new user fields that are created as part of an integration are listed in the \"Fields\" section of each doc. These fields will be added to new and existing user profiles as described in the section above, and they will become available for segmentation in the audience builder. Raw Event Data If data is imported to Lytics without being mapped by LQL, this data is stored as raw fields in data streams, which are un-actionable. For example, if you are importing custom data via CSV, you will need queries in place for the raw data to be meaningful. In addition, some pre-built integrations may import additional fields that are not mapped as part of the default queries provided by the out-of-the-box integration. You may contact support for assistance with mapping these fields. Content In addition to user data, some integrations may ingest content that can be analyzed and processed by the Lytics Content Affinity Engine. An example of this is the MailChimp Import which, in addition to user data, brings in content from your MailChimp email campaigns. This content can help inform affinity scores for users who have viewed and interacted with the email. Metrics This is an uncommon pattern in existing integrations, but Lytics can also import specific metrics from third-party tools. For example, in the Goal Canvas, Facebook Experience metrics are imported directly from the Facebook Insights API. Metrics that are imported to Lytics are accessible via the Metrics API. PGP Encryption File imports and exports can be decrypted and encrypted, respectively using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). To create or ingest PGP encrypted files, use an authorization that includes PGP keys. PGP Public Key authorizations are used to encrypt exports. PGP Private Key authorizations are used to decrypt imports. Follow the instructions below when creating a PGP authorization. PGP Public Key Use a PGP Public Key authorization to encrypt file exports. You will need to generate an armored PGP key pair if you haven't already. In the PGP Public Key field, enter your public key. Be sure to include the header and footer of the armored key. This means your entry should begin and end with the following: -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- and -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- If your key does not begin and end with these strings respectively, it is possible it has not been ASCII armored. PGP Private Key Use a PGP Private Key authorization to decrypt file imports. You will need the private key that is paired with the public key used to encrypt the file. In the PGP Private Key field, enter your private key. Be sure to include the header and footer of the armored key. This means your entry should begin and end with the following: -----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK----- and -----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK----- If your key does not begin and end with these strings respectively, it is possible it has not been ASCII armored. If your private key has been protected with a passphrase, enter the passphrase in the field labeled PGP Private Key Passphrase . If your private key is not passphrase protected, leave this field empty. Note : in order for Lytics to decrypt the file successfully, you will need to provide the private key that is paired with the public key that was used to encrypt the file. Templating User profile fields can be dynamically inserted into an alert using  templating of supported fields including the alert title, alert subtitle, and alert body fields. Lytics uses Golang's template package to provide this functionality. The data available to you will vary based on the data available on each individual profile. You can download a customer profile to see a list of fields available on your user profiles. For example, if you want to include a user's name in an alert and the field containing the name is called first_name , a template like the following could be used: Hey, {{ .first_name }} Notice the \".\" before the name of the profile field. Some profiles may not have a first-name field. To avoid sending an incoherent alert when you don't have the first name field available, a template like the following could be used: {{ if .first_name }}Hey, {{ .first_name }}{{ else }}I wish I knew you{{ end }} Alternatively, if you would rather include a default name when the field does not exist on the profile, a template like the following could be used: Hey, {{.last_name | default \"valued customer\"}} If you would like to make sure that multiple fields on a profile exist, a template like the following could be used: {{ if and .first_name .last_name }}Hey, {{ .first_name }} {{ .last_name }}{{ else }}I don't know you{{ end }} To check equality on a particular profile field, you can create a template like the following: {{ if eq .subscriber_status “subscribed” }}You are a subscriber!{{ else }}You should subscribe!{{ end }} Updated over 1 year ago",

    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Introduction Consumers engage with your brand across many channels, resulting in vast amounts of rich behavioral data siloed away across various channel tools. Lytics connects to these channels via Jobs to aggregate and unify that data into a comprehensive view of the customer. This enables you to gain deeper insights, create personalized experiences, and drive revenue. 📘 The landscape in which your consumers interact is broad. To ensure Lytics makes it easy to both collect and deliver essential data, insights, and audiences, we have a variety of integration options . The Basics Import Jobs are managed by Lytics and are responsible for automating, where applicable, the process of: Authenticating and managing a connection to an external system. Gathering data from an external system and ingesting it in Lytics on sensible data streams. Handling errors and \"retry\" logic. Determining the cadence at which the job should run again. Similarly, Export Jobs are managed by Lytics and are responsible for automating, where applicable, the process of: Authenticating and managing a connection to an external system. Gathering data like user attributes, audiences or events from Lytics and exporting it to an external system. Handling errors and \"retry\" logic. Determining the cadence at which the job should run again. Adding a new Job New data import Jobs are added from the Conductor interface by first navigating to the Jobs section under the Pipeline section in the main navigation. From there, you'll click \"+ Create New\" at the top of the list and enter the wizard to guide you through the creation process. Configuring a Job Select a Provider Each Job is first categorized by the provider, making it easy to narrow down the channel you'd like to integrate with. To select a provider, click the tile representing your desired provider, such as \"Google.\" Select Job Type With the provider selected, we'll surface the various ways you can integrate with that particular provider. This will vary significantly by the provider. Select Authorization Method Each provider and job type may require additional authorization to finalize the connection. On the \"select authorization\" step, you can either select an existing authorization or create a new one. When creating a new authorization, you will be asked to provide the required credentials, such as key and secret, to proceed. Create New Authorization You can create it during source configuration if you lack valid authorization for your desired provider/source combination. Click \"Create new Authorization\" above the list, follow the wizard in Vault , and return to where you left off. Configure Job The final step lets you provide the specific configuration details for your chosen provider and job type. Again, the options supported by each provider will vary greatly, and provider-specific integration details should be leveraged to determine the optimal approach. Monitoring a Job Once you have one or more Source jobs running, they will be accessible from the Source list view, as pictured below. This view provides quick access to essential details: Name : Name of job, such as \"Export of High-Value Users to Facebook.\" Authorization : Name of the associated authorization. Provider : Third-party tool that you are connecting with Lytics. Type : Indicates whether the job is an import, export, or enrichment. Status : Current state of a job such as running, paused, completed, etc. Created : Date the job was initially created. Job Status Detailed states are provided to understand better what is happening in the background during a job's lifecycle. These states will vary by job but include: Job Status Description Running The job is actively running. Sleeping The job is not actively running but is scheduled to run again after a given period. A job is sleeping either because the job runs on a periodic cadence with scheduled sleep in between job runs or the job has encountered an error and is sleeping before retrying the request. Failed The job has encountered consecutive errors over 10 hours and is removed from running again. Check the logs to see if there are any fixable issues. Failed works can be resumed, which will schedule it to run again. Failed jobs will be automatically purged after 90 days. Paused A user has paused the job. The work can be scheduled to run again by resuming the job. Paused works will be automatically purged after 90 days. Completed The job has completed all its scheduled tasks and will not be rerun. These will be purged from the job history after 90 days. For more information on job states or troubleshooting failed jobs, see job processing . Job Summary Clicking on any of the items in the Source list will navigate to its dedicated summary view for greater detail. This summary provides all the relevant information about each job you've created in Lytics and an entry point to alter the configuration or status. At the top of the Job Summary page, you’ll find the following quick-access information: Status : Indicates the current state of a job. See the table below for descriptions of each status. Provider : Third-party tool that you are connecting with Lytics, such as Facebook, Google, Mailchimp, etc. Type : Indicates whether the job is an import, export, or enrichment. Job Name : Name of the job, such as “Import Users & Activity” or “Export Audiences.” Authorization : Name of the authorization, such as “Main Salesforce auth.” Created By : Lytics user who created the authorization. Last Updated : Date the job was most recently edited. 📘 You can edit the name and description of an existing job from its summary page to improve the organization and clarity of your account's list of jobs. Metrics The activity chart will provide metrics (if available) on a job's performance to give a better understanding of how your data is flowing in and out of Lytics. You can see the number of profiles the job added, removed, or omitted during the selected time frame. Note this feature is currently in development. Once metrics are available for each job, this chart will become populated. Configuration The configuration section displays a JSON view of your job's current configuration. This includes details such as the authorization used, where data is coming from, which data is being pulled in, etc. Logs The Logs section records the history of events for this job, details about the work completed, and the time each job was run. The logs are helpful to ensure your work is running as expected and for troubleshooting if any issues arise. Below are descriptions of the job events you may see in the logs. Job Events Description Started The job has started running for the first time. Synced The job has completed a unit of work successfully and will continue to run. Error The job has encountered an error and will retry automatically. Sleeping The job is currently sleeping due to external restrictions, such as hitting a provider's API limits. Failed The job has encountered consecutive errors over 10 hours and is removed from running again. Completed The job has completed all its scheduled tasks and will not be rerun. Backfilling Data Some use cases involve having historical data available for segmentation.  This data might be demographic in nature, or describe how customers prefer to be contacted. This document offers guidelines for cases where large amounts of this data must be available in your Lytics account. Best Practices Separate Backfill from Real-time Streams A real-time data stream contains messages sent in response to the activity they describe. This is distinguished from batched data streams, where messages are sent in groups on a given schedule or according to another trigger. For attributes that will be kept updated by a real-time stream, there is the additional requirement to populate that attribute with a substantial amount of pre-existing information, separating that backfilling from now-forward messages. Backfill messages can be sent using multiple means. API loads should be sent via the bulk CSV or bulk JSON endpoints. It is also possible to use integration workflows to import this data, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 . The benefit of separating this data from real-time message streams is that the processing of backfill messages does not impact the processing time of messages received from real-time streams. The bulk imports are processed in parallel to real-time messages. This means that marketing activations reliant on real-time updates are not affected. Utilize Timestamps Whenever possible, all messages should have an explicit timestamp. While all messages are additionally time stamped by Lytics at the time of ingestion, specifying a message timestamp is helpful in all circumstances, particularly in cases when messages are received out of order so that Lytics knows which one is the most up-to-date.  It is essential when a backfill occurs concurrently with a real-time stream of the same attribute. All means of loading data permit specifying timestamps. Via API, this is via a timestamp_field URL parameter. In the Admin UI, data import configuration options feature a menu to pick among the file schema for a timestamp field. Evaluate Necessity All messages imported into your Lytics account are stored in their raw form and represented as profile attributes in the graph. The purpose of storing all messages is to enable the reprocessing of those messages, a process called rebuilding . Rebuilding enables all received messages to be represented differently with different attributes, identity resolution rules, etc. All data ingested into Lytics incrementally increase the overhead of rebuilding, making it a longer and more processing-intensive operation. Therefore, before importing large amounts of data, consider the value/benefit of that data. If there is no clear use case for backfilling, consider skipping it. Updated 4 months ago",

    "title": "Data Streams",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Introduction A data stream is a continuous flow of data generated from various sources such as websites, mobile apps, email providers, social media, and other digital platforms. Data streams typically involve high volumes of data generated in real-time or near-real-time, making it necessary to process and analyze the data as it arrives. Lytics allows for creating any number of data streams to provide logical distinctions among data sources in either type or scope. For example, data describing email subscriber attributes should exist on a different data stream than one describing email subscriber activity. This ensures maximum flexibility when defining the relationships between sources and how they ultimately are unified into a materialized user profile. What is an \"event?\" In Lytics, an \"event\" is an action or activity performed by a user or a customer, such as visiting a website, purchasing, or subscribing to a newsletter. As pictured below, events are showcased as independent key/value pairs on a single data stream. These keys are then translated into Fields & Mappings in order to materialize to user profile for segmentation. Exploring Data Streams Lytics will ingest data that is sent to one of Lytics' Collection APIs: the collect API or the bulk API. The bulk API is generally intended for larger imports of offline data, while the collect API is generally intended for more real-time sources and usage. Viewing Your Data Streams You can view information about your data streams in your Lytics dashboard by navigating to Conductor > Pipeline > Streams . The primary purpose of this section is to verify that data is successfully being received by Lytics. If your account has multiple data streams, you can view a different stream from the dropdown menu above the graph. Many integrations have multiple streams. For instance, it is common for email integrations to have an activity stream and a user stream. Integration streams should be prefixed to help identify the source. You can find the streams for integration under the documentation for that integration. 📘 The number of keys in a data stream can be extremely large. This is normal and does not impact performance. Any keys that comprise less than 0.1% of the data volume OR have not been seen in 7 days will be hidden from display to reduce clutter. Event Ingress Graph The event ingress graph shows the number of events collected on a stream for the selected time period (past day, week, month, 3 months, and year)  and interval (hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly). Above the graph, you will find the time the last message from this stream was received, the source of the data stream, and the number of fields in the stream. 📘 Last message received strives for real time reporting but can lag under a number of conditions including during bulk imports. If a data stream is not updating as expected please contact Lytics Support for assistance. Raw Keys Table Below the event ingress graph is the raw keys table. An event may contain any number of key-value pairs. Each record in this table represents a unique raw key seen on the stream in at least one event. The table has the following information on keys: Column Description Name The name of the key. Predicted Type The assumed data type for the value is determined by sampling the values received. First Seen The date the key was first seen, according to the date of the event. Last Seen The last time a key was seen, according to the date of the event. Times Seen The number of events that contained the key. Unique Values The number of different values seen. Times Used The number of user fields that use the key. In addition to these seven columns, each record in the table can be clicked to open up a set of sample values. This can be used to verify that values are being collected and they match the expected data. 📘 If a key has many different values, the modal may not display all the values for the chosen key. The table can be filtered in three ways: used vs. unused, common vs. uncommon, and text search. Filter Description Used A raw key that is mapped to a user field. Unused Raw keys are collected and stored but never mapped to user fields. Common Raw keys that have been seen more often on events relative to other raw keys based on the times seen value. Uncommon Raw keys are seldom seen on events relative to other raw keys. Hiding Keys Raw event keys can be hidden, but it is important to note that keys cannot be made visible again through the user interface - only through the API. It is recommended that a list is kept of hidden keys in the event one needs to be resurfaced at a later date. If you need assistance, please contact Lytics Support with your key name and account ID. To hide a key: Select the checkbox next to the name of the key or keys. Click Remove selected key . Final Thoughts Having logically differentiated data streams for different data sources also helps to facilitate a more straightforward process for mapping data from data sources to user profiles. However, integrating data from some data providers can make this distinction difficult.  For example, data routers like Segment or Rudderstack can route data from multiple sources into a single destination, like Lytics. Updated 8 months ago",

    "url": "https://docs.lytics.com/docs/understanding-user-profiles",
    "title": "User Profiles",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Introduction User profiles provide relevant insights about individual customers in relation to your entire customer base. Referencing a user profile helps answer questions about who your customers are and how they are engaging with your brand. Initially, the user profile offers a way to test your Lytics implementation and validate the outcomes of your marketing tactics. For example, you can check if campaigns are working as expected by using a “test” persona and seeing how the user profile data gets updated. As you get deeper into building campaigns, the user profile provides insight into how your marketing influences user behaviors. For example, if you run a mobile campaign, you can drill down to see if customers are engaging on mobile devices, what days and times they are most active, and what types of content they are affinity for. User profiles are updated in real-time, but there can be a delay while the data is being processed and scores are being calculated for behavior and content affinity. To provide quick access to customer data, the user profile is divided into three tabs: Intelligence , Audiences , and Details . Anatomy of a User Profile Intelligence The intelligence tab gives a snapshot of key information about an individual user. At the top, a bar is displayed to help you quickly understand user engagement across all channels: Likelihood to re-engage , Current engagement level , and Frequency of user interactions . Each of these boxes summarizes the data science-powered behavioral scores into practical terms. The individual behavior scores and the user’s content affinity are displayed below. This rich data based on a user’s actual behavior is available thanks to the predictive analytics built into Lytics. Recent activity by channel This module gives an overview of which channels (email, web, mobile, etc.) an individual user has been active in. When appropriately mapped, it will also provide information on when users were active on each channel (within the last day or within the last 30 days). NOTE : If this module is empty, please see below for details on how to configure the user fields. As with all data mapping exercises, it is best to include your Customer Success representatives for optimal results. How the recent activity by channel is managed If you are customizing LQL or handling custom streams, it is important to understand how this module should be configured. For all our built-in integrations, Lytics includes this data mapping by default. At its core, the \"Recent activity by channel\" module is built from a single user field. This field will not exist in legacy accounts and must be added to the existing LQL manually. For all new accounts that get the latest default LQL files, the baseline should be included. In order to handle either custom data mapping for an account or backfill an old account, the user field last_channel_activities must be defined in a streams LQL file. This field is defined as a map[string]time and should not be altered. In each stream you'll simply map a string, such as \"web\" or \"email\" to a timestamp such as epochms() in order to update the field. A more lengthy example for an email LQL might look something like: -- Profile Support\nmap(\"email\", epochms())    AS last_channel_activities    IF eq(tolower(action), \"open\") OR eq(tolower(action), \"click\")    SHORTDESC \"Last Activity By Channel\"    KIND map[string]time The example above is for when you only want to map the activity event in the case of a click or open. This definition will vary from stream to stream. When it comes to which keys to use, we recommend following these standards for common channels: email ad web mobile support Unique identifiers Highlights the identifiers that have been used to materialize this particular user's profile. Event chart The event chart shows a user’s activity by hour and day of the week. The top right of the chart highlights when a user is most active, for example Tuesdays at 10am. Audience Membership This tab displays a list of all the current Audiences a user belongs to and the total size of each audience. Audiences include factual information such as “Has Email Address” and “Known Location” along with Lytics score-driven characteristics such as “Deeply Engaged” or “Binge User”. Profile Details The details tab gives an under-the-hood display of the exact user fields contributing to a user’s behavioral data and their audiences. Unique identifiers are shown first, which are essential for enabling cross-channel mapping. For all user fields, the associated stream and value is provided. Profile Picture Some profiles may include a profile picture when viewed in the user interface. This image comes from Gravatar . If the profile in question has an email address, Lytics converts it to an MD5 hash. That hash is then used to look up the corresponding image on Gravatar. This image is only displayed in the Lytics UI and is not part of the profile itself. Updated over 1 year ago",

    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Introduction Cloud Connect allows you to run complex SQL queries directly against your data warehouse and translate the resulting records into profile attributes and audiences. Cloud Connect in Action 📘 Cloud Connect in Action Check out the solution architecture developed with Google which leverages BigQuery and Analytics Hub in addition to Cloud Connect to create a rich pattern for secure data collaboration and activation. Getting Started Accessing Cloud Connect Cloud Connect is available to all Lytics customers. If you don't currently have access via the product switcher at the top of the primary navigation, contact support or your account management team. Common Use-cases Cloud Connect unlocks many use cases enabling marketers to segment their customers based on any attributes stored in their database. A few examples include: Time Window : All users who did not log in last month. Joins (B2B) : All users associated with accounts without feature \"x.\" Lifetime Value (LTV) or Rollup : All users with a premium subscription have purchased at least two products. 📘 Need a warehouse? Don't currently have access to a data warehouse? Lytics has you covered with Lytics Warehouse. We provide a simple data warehouse on top of Google BigQuery to all of our customers as part of Conductor. Simply reach out to account manager or support for access and information. How it Works Cloud Connect augments the rest of the Lytics CDP suite by providing a secure and flexible entry point into your data warehouse. Users can quickly write a standard SQL query to perform a number of complex data manipulations or aggregations and stream the results directly to materialized user profiles. From there, generate insight-heavy reports, enrich targeted segments, and activate across hundreds of marketing channels in just a few clicks. Below you'll find an overview of the general architecture, which can be summarized into these key value drivers: Direct access to existing customer data in your warehouse. No need to rip and replace or replicate consumer data in order to activate. Leverage standard SQL to extract only what is relevant to your business goals. Maintain your warehouse as the \"source of truth.\" Requires very little to implement and begin generating ROI. Updated about 1 year ago",

    "url": "https://docs.lytics.com/docs/importing-external-experiences",
    "title": "Importing External Experiences",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Importing External Experiences You can import existing marketing initiatives currently managed by your channel providers, which enables you to quickly gain insights about the campaigns you’re already running. You can then take action by connecting these Experiences to your Lytics audiences. While you can monitor Experiences and activate audiences for them within Lytics, the management of external Experiences still happens inside your channel tools. If you want to stop, delete, or edit the execution of an Experience, you need to do so within the provider. If you choose to delete an Experience in Lytics that still has a matching campaign in your channel tool, it will show up on the import list and can be re-imported. Centralize cross-channel reporting Lytics serves as a central hub to monitor your cross-channel marketing, making it easier to understand and improve the performance of  your campaigns. For example, instead of logging into Facebook to check your ad campaign metrics and Iterable to check your email newsletter open rates, you can monitor the performance of both tools within your Lytics dashboard. To start monitoring external Experiences on Lytics, follow the batch import steps. Monitor Experiences via batch import On your Lytics dashboard, navigate to Experiences , and select Add Experiences > Import . Select your provider The Lytics Canvas connects out-of-the-box with select channel providers. Over time, more providers will be added to this list. If you want to use a provider that is not currently available, you can use the \"Generic Experience\" workflow to export Lytics audiences to any of your integrated providers. Authorize Next, you will be prompted to select an authorization for your chosen provider. Existing authorizations will be shown. If you have multiple accounts within a particular channel such as Facebook, you will choose which account to import from. If you don’t have an authorization, you will be prompted to add one before continuing. For Facebook, there is a second step for authorizing Ad Set ID after you’ve selected your account ID. Import Experiences Finally, select the Experiences you want to import into Lytics (up to 10 at a time). The total number of Experiences you can bring into Lytics is only limited by the amount in your connected provider. However, to have meaningful and accurate reporting, it's recommended to only import Experiences that will add value to your use cases. Completed experiences, such as an Ad Set that previously \"ended\", will not show on the list of importable Experiences. But if you have Ad Sets in Facebook that are saved as drafts, paused, or currently running, those will be available to import. Connect Experiences with Lytics audiences Once you start monitoring external Experiences, you can activate them by adding a Lytics audience. This lets you enrich your existing campaigns with Lytics behavioral audiences, content affinities, and delivery optimization. An example use case is to conserve Facebook ad spend by only targeting “Currently Engaged” users who have a high affinity for the content of a particular campaign. Leveraging data science under the hood, Lytics audiences can bring immediate value to your existing marketing campaigns. If you have already imported an external Experience, you can activate it from the Experience summary view by clicking Edit in the top right. If you want to activate an Experience that you haven't imported yet, follow the single import steps below, which will guide you through the Experience editor. Activate Experiences via single import To activate an Experience that you haven't imported yet, you will follow the workflow of creating a new Experience in Lytics. From the Experiences list view, click Add Experiences > New . Select your chosen provider and then Import the campaign, ad set, or journey. This example will continue with importing a SendGrid campaign. Next you will select an Authorization for your chosen provider as described above. Then you will select the campaign or ad set to import. Note that here you can only import one Experience at a time. Click Import 1 Experience to continue. Complete the Experience Editor steps Finally, you will complete the following Experience Editor steps: Target: configure your target audience for this Experience. Configure provider: choose how the audience for your Experience will be exported to the third-party tool. Configure delivery: option to automatically determine when to deliver messages to individual users on the third-party tool. Upon completion, your Experience will be ready to publish.

    "content": "There are many reasons why Lytics and partners need to communicate across different tools, here are some best practices on how to get the most out of your communication with Lytics staff. Please note, that this is not an exhaustive list of scenarios, the following should be considered a guideline. Community - Lytics has a community section on their docs site where users of Lytics can ask general questions about Lytics, how to use Lytics, and what’s possible with Lytics. Think of this community area as your Lytics Stackoverflow. The Lytics Community can be found here. Some examples of community-type questions are: “Regarding the NLP engine, are you able to scrape all the contents of, apply topics to, and associate topic scores to users on PDFs?” “Can one set up alerts for jobs failing and/or being deleted like you can set up alerts for event overages?” “Is there an endpoint I can hit to see hidden streams?” Customer-specific questions or questions that regard Solution Architecture (complex) for a customer are not suitable for the Community section and should be asked in Zendesk. Zendesk - All customers and partners working on behalf of customers can use the Lytics Support Portal for the following: Report technical issues with the Lytics platform, e.g. Bug reports Feature Requests Solution architecture questions that require discretion with customer needs Assistance with features that may not be accessible by a partner or customer Partners can contact the Lytics support team through support.lytics.com or [email protected] , which will create a Zendesk ticket. Slack & Email - Partners are encouraged to communicate directly with the Lytics team for other partnership needs. Please prioritize Community and Zendesk for any customer CDP-related questions. Some examples of Email and Slack communications are: Contract questions, billing invoices, or other administrative needs Partnership questions Lytics Training Customer status check-ins Meeting coordination Customer-specific issues that are not appropriate in the Lytics public Community forum Updated 3 months ago",

    "title": "Consent & Privacy",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Introduction As businesses continue to collect and utilize customer data to power their marketing efforts, obtaining, managing, and enforcing proper consent is crucial. This is important for complying with various privacy laws and regulations and maintaining trust with customers. This document will explore the importance of granularity in a consent strategy and how Lytics can assist in the consent management process. We will cover best practices to consider and provide guidance on where to get started. The following four steps will be outlined: Data Collection : How to collect consent adequately from disparate sources consistently. Profile Materialization : How to flexibly surface the state of consent to individual user profiles. Segmentation : How can the required consent rules be enforced when driving downstream campaigns? Maintenance : How to ensure that your consent strategy scales and flexes to your ongoing market conditions without fail? By following these steps, businesses can establish a solid and effective consent management strategy that respects customer privacy and builds trust. Data Collection To maintain compliance with data privacy regulations, businesses need a clear and flexible path for collecting consent data. Lytics offers a range of SDKs and data collection APIs to support this effort. When approaching consent data collection, it is essential to consider the following: The source of the data and any inherent limitations. Can it be real-time, or does it need to be batch? The granularity of the consent. Is this a simple boolean, on or off, or is this something more granular, like opting into a particular communication method? Additional context related to the consent that may be important for your needs. Are there specific forms that are being consented to or a unique source? To address these considerations, Lytics has developed a suggested schema to get you started. Of course, this can always be customized via Conductor to meet your specific needs. Data Structure Effective consent management requires a comprehensive set of properties that can be deployed to ensure compliance and maintain customer trust. These properties should cover various aspects of data collection, storage, and usage and provide businesses with the tools to manage consent-related data effectively. Schema Property Description Event Name Using a standardized event name for consent collection provides crucial context that can be utilized through if/else rules for individual mappings. By leveraging different event names, such as \"consent-type-1\" versus \"consent-type-2,\" it becomes easier to differentiate between multiple types of consent on a single profile as events stream in and is subsequently mapped. This approach enables businesses to maintain a more granular and organized record of consent-related data. Consented A clear and concise confirmation, or lack thereof, reduces the possibility of accidentally mapping consent when consent has been denied or not yet collected. Location An optional parameter to build context around a user's location that may become important. Are they consenting to something location specific? Date An optional parameter to build context around when consent was most recently given. Date may be important if consent is valid for a specified length of time and may help support efforts to gather consent in the event that the consent timeframe has lapsed. Documents The \"documents\" array within the default schema represents additional context that can be used to specify the source of consent. For instance, this field can indicate whether the consent was given via a global site-wide agreement or a specific call to action during a purchase. While the data manager determines the values and format of this field, including this information helps ensure that critical context is not lost during execution. Examples 📘 We are here to help! Consent is not a one size fits all scenario. Each customers data and business goals are unique. Before deploying any of the following examples it is always recommended to consult with your Technical Account Manager or a Solutions Architect. Lytics deploys a flexible data model, and though the following is not representative of every method of collection, we've highlighted two working examples leveraging our available SDKs as a baseline: Collecting Consent via the Web: Lytics JavaScriptTag JavaScript jstag.send({\n  \"event\": \"form-submit\",\t\n  \"consent\": {\n    \"purpose\": \"global\",\n    \"location\": \"Portland, OR\",\n    \"documents\": [\"generic-submit-form\"],\n    \"consented\": true\n  }\n}) Collecting Consent via Mobile: Lytics iOS SDK Lytics.shared.consent(\n  name: \"consent-1\",\n  identifiers: AnyCodable([\n    \"userid\": \"my-fake-userid-1234\"\n  ]),\n  attributes: AnyCodable([\n    \"firstName\": \"Kevin\",\n    \"lastName\": \"McCalister\"\n  ]),\n  consent: AnyCodable([\n    \"documents\": [\n      \"terms_jan_2023\",\n      \"sharing_policy_jan_2023\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Chicago, IL\",\n    \"consented\": true\n  ])\n) 📘 When using Lytics SDKs, you do not have to include date within the data passed in the consent event. The timestamp of the consent event can be used to create the field and mapping for the date of consent. Profile Materialization Building from the collection strategy outlined in Collecting Consent Data , we must determine how to materialize the consent-related data we've just collected to user profiles for segmentation. This can be achieved in a variety of ways. Regardless of the approach, however, it is essential to consider the level of granularity of the consent. Granularity When collecting consent from users, obtaining granular consent for each specific use of a customer's personal data is an important consideration. Granular consent means that customers are provided with a clear understanding of the exact purposes for which their personal data will be used and can choose to consent or withhold consent for each specific use case. For example, a business may seek granular consent from a customer to collect their email address and use it to send them promotional emails but not to share the email address with third-party partners for advertising purposes. This approach allows customers to make more informed decisions about how their personal data is used and provides greater control over their privacy. Obtaining granular consent not only requires careful planning and clear communication with customers about the specific use cases for their personal data but also a rock-solid means for enforcing an individual's consent wishes across all future touchpoints. Schema Enforcement begins by ensuring consent wishes are accurately materialized on each user's profile. This is done by first defining consent-related attributes to be used in segmentation. Field Definition When defining profile fields, there are two primary considerations. What type of field should be used, such as a string or a map and how do you want to handle data merging when profiles are stitched? Field Type Type Benefits Drawbacks Map (Recommended) A map is the most straightforward approach, allowing you to add additional context with minimum overhead. You create one field and map multiple data points to that field. During segmentation, maps may be slightly more challenging to navigate. Because the keys that are nested under the map are not part of the top-level schema, you'll need to drill into the field to build segments vs. searching at the top level. String When building segments, because all consent fields would be at the top level of the schema, it may be easier to find and select the contextual data. When using a string, you can only store a single value. This represents a heavier lift during the initial setup, as you'll need to create many fields to facilitate a single consent use case. Merge Operator Type String Because consent is something that may change for a consumer over time, the values must represent the most recent data. As such, the latest merge operator is always recommended. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a field will win. Example String Type Map For a more complex or granular consent strategy, the map field type can be very helpful in accurately managing consent. As such, the merge merge operator is always recommended when trying to keep the key-value pairs up to date to the most recent consent state. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a key-value pair will win. Example Map Mapping Definition Mappings are then leveraged to determine how data from any number of streams map to the defined field. In the example below, we take a simple approach to map the boolean value of true or false to the consent field if the consent is related to marketing-consent . Though this is one elementary example, the same practice can be replicated to ensure a consent attribute has the status, timestamp, and context of any important policies or sources for segmentation. Example Segmentation Businesses can better understand their customers and create more effective campaigns by breaking down audiences into smaller, more targeted segments. Here we will discuss best practices for constructing \"building block\" audiences related to consent that can then be leveraged in campaign audiences. This progressive approach ensures consent rules are enforced while minimizing ongoing maintenance overhead. Building Blocks Building Block Audience s provide the perfect means to maintain consent-related rules and extend the ruleset to all campaign audiences. The number and these audiences will depend on the granularity of your consent strategy. Still, as a basic example, we recommend creating both a \"has consented\" and \"has not consented\" counterpart for each level of consent. This can be done simply through the GUI for our powerful segmentation engine, as shown below: Campaign Segments Once you have the necessary building blocks constructed, you can quickly integrate that rule set into your campaign audiences again through the GUI for our segmentation engine. The example below outlines a use case where you want to target high-value users who have opted in. Global Job Segment Filter (Consent) Configure a segment to prevent profiles from being sent to downstream destinations based on consent status or another relevant filter. This ensures that individuals who should be excluded will not be activated downstream. API documentation can be found here . Updated 5 months ago",

    "title": "Chrome Extension",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension Overview The Lytics Dev Tools Chrome extension is a comprehensive tool designed to simplify validation, debugging, and exploration of Lytics' client-side capabilities as facilitated by our core and personalization SDKs. With this extension, users can easily: Validate that Lytics is connected to your site. Debug and validate that the data collected by Lytics, be it automatic or custom, is behaving as expected. Explore the current visitor's full profile to validate: If the profile is available for personalization. The events collected are having the expected impact on attributes and segment membership. Explore \"Experiences\" currently active on your site and could be surfaced to visitors. Installation Install Now Install Extension: This extension is installed directly into your Chrome browser. To install, visit the primary extension page and follow the instructions. Pin Extension to Nav Bar: Once installed, we recommend pining the extension to your top bar for easy access. Getting Started Once the extension is installed, you can visit any website where Lytics is or should be installed and begin debugging. Enable the extension : To activate the Lytics Dev Tools extension, open the extension and toggle the slider at the top right of the extension to either \"Enable\" or \"Disable.\" Verify Installation: The extension will verify that the Lytics tag has been installed successfully before further debugging. This is confirmed by the \"Lytics JavaScript SDK Installed\" alert displayed on the dashboard of the extension. Navigation: Once enabled, you'll access three key sections: Debugger, Profile, and Personalization, each offering specific functionalities tailored to streamline your debugging and exploration process. Debugger The debugger section of the extension serves multiple purposes. Firstly, as we did previously, it allows you to validate installation, ensuring that the Lytics tag is successfully implemented. Additionally, it provides access to the full active configuration of the JavaScript SDK through the configuration tab. Moreover, it includes a live event debugger that monitors and displays comprehensive details of any calls made to the Lytics APIs in real time. This feature is particularly valuable for reviewing data sent via jstag.send calls, offering insights into the interaction between your website and Lytics APIs. Profile In the \"Profile\" section of the extension, users gain a live look at the current visitor's profile, providing valuable insights into their browsing behavior and demographic information. This section offers a snapshot of key details, such as the visitor's unique identifier and behavioral scores, allowing for a quick assessment of their engagement level. Additionally, users can access a detailed view of all information available to the browser, including demographic data, past interactions, and any custom attributes stored in the visitor's profile. This comprehensive overview enables users to tailor their strategies and personalize experiences based on individual visitors' specific characteristics and preferences. Personalization In the \"Personalization\" section of the extension, users gain access to a log of all active Lytics experiences and campaigns, along with their associated details. This feature proves invaluable when debugging the configuration of experiences or ensuring that overrides have produced the expected results. Users can easily track the performance and behavior of each personalized element on their website by providing a comprehensive overview of active campaigns and experiences, including their parameters and settings. This functionality streamlines debugging and empowers users to fine-tune their personalization strategies for optimal effectiveness. Updated 11 months ago",

    "title": "Audiences",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Introduction Audiences are central to creating personalized marketing using Lytics. It is how groups of users get targeted and defines how cross-channel user data is used in campaigns. Lytics offers audiences as a tool that operates on user fields as well as other audiences. This provides the ability to craft audiences that target one user, every user, or any number in between. Lytics audiences are automatically kept up to date. As time passes, an audience that once targeted 500 users may grow to target 10,000. This is great if your audience is targeting engaged users who have shown interest in your upcoming product, but not so great if your audience targets users with outstanding support tickets. Lytics makes it easy to find these insights so your campaign strategies can be adjusted accordingly. Audiences can be used in Lytics Experiences, third-party ad campaigns, and tools like Google BigQuery for advanced reporting. When all of that isn’t enough, the Lytics APIs provide deep integrations with the Lytics platform. 📘 Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences . Once on the Audiences page, click on the + Create New Audience button. Creating Audiences Building new audiences allows you to target specific groups of your users. Why send the same email to your entire audience? Instead, send emails to distinct audiences with content that you know those users enjoy. Lytics gives you the ability to create audiences based on cross channel user data, behaviors and interests. Audiences can be built using existing audiences, user content affinity, your personalization campaigns, or by custom rules utilizing any user fields in your Lytics account. Create rulesets by combining multiple audiences and boolean logic to target users with as much or as little granularity as you require. Lytics updates your audiences automatically. Once an audience is built, users will join or leave whenever they match (or fail to match) the rules you have set. Export your audiences, often in real-time, to your integrated marketing tools giving you the power of Lytics however you engage with your users. 📘 Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences . Once on the Audiences page, click on the + Create New Audience button. Building Audiences: Existing Audiences The Existing Audiences tab in the audience builder contains a list of all existing audiences and their size categorized by audience type such as characteristic. Characteristics are pre-built audiences pertaining to single user attributes such as location or behavior. Keep in mind that the audience sizes you see in this list are not real-time. They are updated every few hours for performance reasons. When creating or editing an audience, however, you will always see real-time numbers so that you can make precise decisions based on accurate data. You can use the Filter by Audience Type drop-down to filter the list or use the Search box to quickly find an audience by name. Select an audience or characteristic to add it to the definition of the audience you are building or editing. Building Audiences: Content Affinity The Content Affinity tab in the audience builder is used to add Affinity-based rules to your audience. Since Affinities are a group of related Topics , this allows you to effectively target users interested in several subjects or products. In the example above, we created a \"Lavender\" Affinity for an online beauty store, which includes 6 Topics such as \"lavender\", \"lavender lotion\", and \"lavender luxury.\" Instead of creating an audience with 6 rules (one per Topic), we just select our Lavender Affinity that contains those 6 Topics. Once you choose an Affinity for your audience, you will be able to select the range of affinity values. The histogram displays the distribution of user interest for the selected Affinity and is helpful to build an audience that has the desired size. By default, users with Any Affinity are selected. You can choose a built-in range by clicking any of the Affinity buttons or, to set a custom range, use the slider to refine the range of users to target. As you change the range, the total number of users that fit the range is shown in the right column. As soon as you create an Affinity, Lytics start scoring users against it as they interact with your content or products. For active users, you can expect this number to start populating within a few days. For inactive users, it can take up to 2 weeks for them to be scored against an Affinity. So it's recommended that you create Affinities in advance of the audience needed for an Affinity-based campaign. Topic-Based Audiences Under the Custom Rule tab in the Audience Builder, you can find the existing audiences based on Topics in your content taxonomy. If you want to create new audiences based on a single Topic, you can do so as follows: Search for \"Topics\" in the Custom Rule tab of the Audience Builder Select the Topic of interest. Set the threshold according to the desired users' level of interest in that Topic. Once you hit \"Add Condition\", the custom rule for a Topic will look like this: Although Topics are still supported in the Audience Builder, we strongly recommend you use Affinities to build audiences for a more efficient workflow and more effective targeting. Inferred Content Affinity Some users may find a field named Inferred Content Affinity when trying to build affinity or topic based audiences. This field contains topics that a user could be interested in even though they may not have interacted with the topics directly. To learn more about how these inferrences are made, you can read about our content taxonomy process . Note that topic affinity already includes this information, but this field contains only inferred affinity. We would also recommend not using this field to build audiences as it is not a wholistic view of a user's affinity. Building Audiences: Custom Rules The Custom Rules tab in the audience builder is used to add any rule based on a user field to the audience being built or edited. Custom rules allow for ultimate access of all data that is aggregated in user fields. Custom rules are simple statements that can be combined to create very precise audiences. Using them correctly requires a thorough understanding of the data being used, but there is no replacement for this level of segmentation. 🚧 Audiences Field Value Limits Audiences can have a maximum of 1,000 field values. \"Values\" in this context apply to a single evaluation against a user field. When exceeded, the error message \"Audience too large! Remove values to save this audience\" will be displayed. For example, the following scenarios would trigger the alert: An audience with a single rule that supports multiple values ( e.g. contains one of) with 1001+ values. An audience with 1001+ user field rules each with a single evaluation (e.g. exists). Any variation in between such as two rules each containing over 500 evaluations, etc. The user field list displays all the fields in your account. The Source drop-down can be used to filter on the data stream the user field came from. The Includes drop-down can be used to filter user fields on the percentage of users that have a field. Use the Search input to search for a user field by name. Generally, to add a Custom Rule to an audience definition: Choose a User Field Choose an operator (e.g., text contains, value is less than) Choose a value There are variations to this general procedure based on the type of the user field and the operator chosen. User Field Types How you work with user fields in the Custom Rules tab will depend on way the field is mapped in on the user profile. Numeric User Fields Numeric user fields are most commonly used for data that is counted. For instance, the number of times a visitor has been to a website or the number of times a subscriber has opened an email. Exact values can be matched, but more commonly, inequalities are expressed. Examples: Total Number of Visits must equal 5: Any user who has visited 4 times, 6 times, or any number of times other than 5 will not be matched by this rule. Total Number of Visits must be less than 3: Any user who has visited 0, 1, or 2 times will be matched by this rule. Text User Fields Text User fields are commonly used for words and miscellaneous information. For instance, a user’s first name. Since there is no mathematical relationship between two text values, the operations used are generally exact match or partial match. There are 5 operator options when making audiences with text user fields: Equal : The value for the field you want the audience to have. Format and character spacing for the value must match exactly what is in the data stream. You can select the value by interacting with the visualization or be promoted with available values by typing into the search bar. Contain : The text entered (case sensitive and exact order) appears within a value for the field. Be Like : Use the wildcard character * along with text to decide the parts of values you want to match. E.g., test will only match on the exact string test, while test* will match strings starting with test, such as \"testing\", and *test* will match any string that has test in it, such as \"my test case\". Equal one of : Add each, exact value you want included individually. A new search bar will appear after each selection. You can remove values from the list using the “x” to the left of the value. The logic for each of these rules follows the logic from “Equal”. Exist : Excludes everyone that does not have a value for the field. Examples First Name must equal Ash: Only users named Ash will be matched. First name must contain Ash: Any user named Ash will be matched. Additionally, anyone named Ashley, Ashton, or any other name that has the letters \"Ash\" next to each other will be matched. Dash or Natasha will NOT be matched - as these do not have an “A.” To make an audience that includes these, create a second rule set for “First name must contain ash.” Date User Fields Date user fields are commonly used for any data that represents a point in time. For instance, the last time a user visited a website. Most commonly, a date is chosen to divide the people who fall before or after that date. You will need to select both your starting point and a direction in time for your custom rule. Your starting point could be a fixed point in time (useful for milestone events, like product launches) or a relative point in time (useful for scheduled follow ups). Since each rule only handles going forward or backward from a single point in time, you may need to create two rules that work together to bound a range of time. One rule will capture all dates after the first point in time, and a second rule will capture all dates before a later point in time. Some date fields have a natural boundary, such as Last Visits, which will never include a date in the future. If you want all Last Visits from a point in time up until now, you would only need to create one rule. Examples Last Visit must be Before June 22, 2016: Created by selecting Specific Date and the direction Before . This rule includes only users who have not visited since the 22nd of June. Last Visit must be After 3 days in the past: Created by selecting Relative Date , entering 3 days In the past and selecting the direction After . This rule includes only users who have visited in the last three days. Subscription End Date must be within the next 30 days: Created by building two rules: one to set the start date to always be the current date and the other to set the end date to 30 days in the future relative to the current date. Create the first rule by selecting Relative Date , After , entering 0 Days , selecting In the past , and clicking Add Condition . Create the second rule by selecting Relative Date , Before , 30 Days , In the future , and clicking Add Condition . This audience will now include all users who have a subscription ending in the next 30 days beginning with the current date. Set User Fields Set user fields are commonly used for collecting related data over time. For instance, all the URLs a user has visited. These fields are generally used much like text user fields, even though the data is structured differently. Examples All URL Paths Ever must contain one of /blog , /products , or /about : Any user who has visited any one of these three paths will be matched. Followed Sports must contain Baseball: Any user who follows Baseball will be matched. This is true whether they only follow Baseball or follow Baseball in addition to Football, Hockey, and Bowling. Map/Nested User Fields Map user fields are used to add hierarchy to a dynamic domain of data. For instance, Events By Device is a count of all events, but grouped by each device. So instead of building a rule by only specifying the count, the rule is built by first specifying the device, then the count. The device could be thought of as an additional, dynamic user field that is nested under the map user field. Selecting a Key When using a map user field, the first step is selecting the dynamic user field to build a rule with, called a key . Using the URLs Visited example, the keys could include any numeric value. Since these keys are dynamic,  counts will be updated automatically. Building the Condition Once a key is selected a condition is built. The type of the nested user field is called the value type . In the case of URLs Visited , the value type is numeric. When building audiences with nested fields, the visualization chart will not display for mapped fields to minimize page load times. Examples Events By Device (Desktop) must be greater than 5: Only users who have visited the website more than 5 times on a desktop will be matched. If a user has visited more than 5 times on the mobile web, they will not be matched. Signup Date for Event (Personalization Webinar) must be within the last 7 days: Only the users who signed up for the Personalization Webinar in the last week will be matched. Users who signed up more than 7 days ago will not be matched. Users who signed up for a different event in the last 7 days will also not be matched. Out of the Box Custom Rules Some user fields are mapped by default and populated through the use of the Lytics Javascript tag and Experiences. These out of the box fields can be incredibly useful when building audiences using Custom Rules. Lytics Javascript Tag Assuming that you have not made changes to the 'default' web LQL file that is automatically created when the Lytics Javascript Tag is installed, the following custom rules are available to you for use when building audiences. Rule Description All channels used (web, email, etc.) All the channels a user has been active in based on the data imported into your Lytics account. Bot The Lytics JavaScript Tag captures information from the web browser to determine if the user is bot or not. When data is collected from the Lytics JavaScript Tag, that request will include the user-agent of the client that was used to initiate the request. The user agent is parsed and evaluated using a third party library . That evaluation determines if the request is from a \"bot\" or not. NOTE : The third party library does not capture all bots. Created Timestamp The timestamp of when a user profile was created. When an anonymous and known profile is merged the oldest timestamp is retained. Devices Used Any devices a user has used e.g. desktop, Android, iOS. Event First Time Seen Captures the timestamp of the first event sent through from your website by either your tag manager or the Lytics JavaScript Tag, along with some details around what that event was. Event Last Time Seen Captures the timestamp of the last event sent through from your website from either your tag manager or our Lytics JavaScript Tag, along with some details around what that event was. Last Active The last timestamp on the profile that indicated activity on web or any connected sources importing activity data to your account. Last Activity by Channel The last timestamp on the profile that indicated activity on a particular channel. Last Visit City Pulled from visit_city field from your Default (web) source and indicates the last value seen. Last Visit Country Pulled from visit_country field from your Default (web) source and indicates the last value seen. Last Visit State/Province Pulled from visit_region field from your Default (web) source and indicated last value seen. Modified Timestamp The last time that a profile was updated. Random, uniform partition of users Every profile in Lytics is assigned a random number between 1-100. By using this rule, you can perform simple A/B tests to decrease the size of an audience for testing down to a certain percentage of the total audience size. Read more about simple AB testing. Score Frequency, Intensity, Momentum, Propensity, Quntatiy, or Recency. The values of the user's Lytics behavorial scores. See Lytics Scores for detailed descriptions of these fields. Time of First Visit The time of a user’s first visit to your website since the Lytics JavaScript Tag was installed. Time of Last Visit The time of a user’s last website visit. Timezone The timezone they are in based on their last web session. Total Number of Visits Total number of different times a user has come to your website. Total Pageview Count A user’s lifetime total of pageviews. User Agent The last browser user agent of the user e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge. Web Cookie ID(current) The cookie id of the last session a user had on your website. Web Cookie IDs(all) All of the cookie ids tied to a user. Web Domains Visited All the domains a user has visited that have the Lytics JavaScript Tag installed. Web Events by Hour Number of tracked events for each hour of the day in 24 hour UTC time . Web Events by Week Number of tracked events for each hour in a week. Experiences There are a variety of use cases that involve targeting users who have engaged with previous marketing campaigns. For example, if a user converted on an Iterable Experience email, and you want to follow up with an SMS message. The steps below will walk you through how to create an audience to target users who were reached by or clicked on an Experience . Navigate to Experiences and search for the one you would like to use. You will need to get an ID for the Experience, which differs depending on the Experience type: For Lytics Web Personalization Experiences : Look up the URL for this Experience and locate the long string of numbers of letters as highlighted below. Save this to your clipboard. For all other Experience types : open developer tools and navigate to the “Network” tab. Refresh the page and filter the requests by “experience”. Find the response that looks similar to the example below, and save the external_id value (nested under vehicle ) to your clipboard. Note: You can also use the Experience API to fetch the current Experience by ID to get the full payload, including the Experience's external_id . In your Lytics account, navigate to Audiences > Create New Audience . In the audience builder, select Custom Rule and search for the provider of the Experience you would like to segment on. After you enter a provider, you should see a field for conversions and reach on those Experience types. Select the action you wish to segment off of. Copy and paste the ID you copied from step 2 into the text box. Choose Exist as your operator and add the condition to your audience. Select Add Condition . You now have an audience based on past interactions with an Experience. You can save the audience as is, or continue to add rules based on your use case. Building Audiences: Multiple Rules and Rule Sets All audience definitions are comprised of rules based on existing audiences , content affinity , campaigns , and custom rules . You may have noticed that after you add your first rule in the audience builder you have the option to Add New Rule or Add New Rule Set . Adding new rules and rulesets, and setting the conditions for their interaction, gives you the ability to refine which users your audiences target. Working With Multiple Rules This audience has a single rule: included all users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers . This will select all users with an intensity score of 20 or less but with a frequency score of 20 or greater. These are users who interact often but not on a deep level. You can refine this rule further by clicking Add New Rule . This audience now also includes a rule for users who have a low content affinity for Technology content. Now that it has been added, there are three numbers of interest. The first number, 87,650, is the number of users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers . The second number, 466,730, is the number of users who have low affinity for Technology content. The third number, 11,514, are the users who meet both of these conditions. Clicking the And/Or toggle, will switch the way the two rules intereact. The audience now includes all 542,921 users who either have the characteristic Behavior: Perusers or have low afffinity for Technology content. Excluding Rules In addition to the And/Or toggle, there is the Included/Excluded toggle. This toggle inverts a condition. This audience contains a rule that targets the 159,084 users with the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile or users who have used a mobile devices. Clicking the Include/Exclude toggle the audience will now target the 705,166 users who do not have the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile . The sum of the two numbers will be the total audience size that meets those rule(s). This is especially apparent when using a rule such as Created Timestamp Exists . Every user in Lytics will have a timestamp of when they were created. Therefore, the number of users who do not meet the condition of having a created timestamp will always be 0. Working With Rule Sets When building elaborate audiences, having a single set of rules that are evaluated using either an AND or an OR is not enough. A ruleset is a set of rules that itself can be used as a rule for an even larger set of rules that is again evaluated using an AND or an OR . This audience has two rulesets. The first ruleset has one rule: all users who have the characteristic Email Capture Status: Known Email . The second ruleset has two rules: all users have some affinity for Marketing OR Advertising content. Combining these two rulesets with the AND operator produces an audience that targets users with an email address that have some interest in either marketing or advertising. This audience could be used to email a special newsletter or promotion about a product or trending topic that is related to marketing or advertising. Excluding Rule Sets Rulesets, just like rules, can be excluded. Clicking the Include/Exclude toogle on the second ruleset will result in the audience targeting all users with an email address who do not have some interest in either marketing or advertising. It could be used to send a different email to the remainder of your users with email addresses. Building Audiences: Configuration Options Configure your Lytics audiences with the following options to execute your use cases. Enabling API Access By default, newly created Lytics audiences are not enabled for API access and thus will not be available to public APIs. Enabling API access is necessary when integrating with other client-side tags/ pixels, Pathfora , or the Lytics personalization API endpoints. Select the API Accessible checkbox to enable access. Generate Insights Lytics Insights provide visibility into the performance of your audiences and campaigns as users interact with your brand. Insights are generated out-of-the-box for Lytics Behavioral and Engagement audiences. You can also request up to 10 custom audiences to be prioritized as candidates for generating Insights. When creating a new audience or editing an existing one, select the Generate Insights checkbox to make that audience a candidate for Insights (shown in the screenshot above). Lytics prioritizes Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences for your account. Therefore, even if you select the \"Generate Insights\" option for a particular audience, it is not guaranteed to show up in your Insights drawer. Managing Audiences Managing audiences becomes important as an account develops and your user base grows. Audiences are critical to both targeted campaigns as well as discovering insights about your users. The Audiences section of Lytics houses all of your account’s audiences. You can view, create, and manage audiences from this section. Audiences are listed alphabetically by default. Click any column header to change the sort property. Common sort options are Last Modified and Size (the number of users in the audience). Naming Your Audiences For better targeting, Lytics encourages the creation of many audiences. They’re easy and free to make. When working with a large library of audiences, naming conventions become important. Name your audiences by purpose and include any categorization in the name. Giving them a common prefix (e.g., Holiday Promo: Tech lovers, Holiday Promo: Loyal Shoppers) will help you to keep everything related next to each other in the user interface. Audiences appear throughout the Lytics platform. Make sure your naming convention works in any context to avoid confusion. Finding Audiences The easiest way to find an audience is to use the Search box. As you enter your search term the audience list will display any matching audiences. 📘 Fuzzy matching is used to search for audiences so the results will not be an exact match to the search term. Editing Audiences Occasionally you will want to return to previously created audiences and update the logic used to create the segment. Find the audience you would like to edit Click on the audience to navigate to the overview of the audience Click the Edit button to enter the audience builder Make your desired changes within the audience builder Click Save 🚧 When editing audiences that are in an active triggered workflow, it is recommended that you reconfigure the job after the audience changes have been made. Duplicating Audiences Find the audience you would like to duplicate Click on the audience to navigate to the overview of the audience Click the ... button to enter the audience builder. The audience builder will be pre-populated with all of the criteria of the audience you duplicated. Make any desired changes Click Save 🚧 Audiences created by duplication will retain the name and slug of the duplicated audience, but with have \"duplicate\" appended at the end. It is recommended that you update both the name and manually input a unique slug name for clarity sake. Deleting Audiences Deleting audiences is an integral part to keeping a tidy workspace in Lytics. Audiences can be deleted in one of two ways: individually or in batch. Note: Deleting an audience does not delete the users associated with that audience. Deleting an Individual Audience From the Browse Audiences list, select the name of the audience you wish to delete. From the options menu, select Delete . Click Delete . Click Accept to confirm. Deleting Multiple Audiences From the Browse Audiences list, select the checkboxes of the audiences you wish to delete. NOTE: Audience selection persists when changing pages allowing you to select audiences from multiple pages. Click Delete Selected Audiences . Click Delete . NOTE: Lytics will check to see if the audiences you selected are safe to delete. Audiences are considered safe if they are not used in an ongoing export, campaign, or another audience's definition. You will be prompted to delete dependant audiences, click Yes to delete the selected audience and any dependants listed or Skip cancel deletion of the selected audience. Click Accept to confirm. Maintaining Audiences 📘 From the Audiences page, click any audience in the list to view all of its details. An audience's landing page contains a lot of valuable information about your users and the audience itself. At the top of the audience page, you will find the following information... Audience name ID Slug Created by Created on date Last updated date API access configuration Below this information you will find multiple tabs where you can access additional information about the audience. Audience Summary The audience summary page is designed to provide insights into the current state of an audience as well as how the audience has changed over time. When first navigating to an audience landing page, this tab will be selected by default. The Summary tab includes the following sections: General Metrics The total number of users in this audience The total percentage of this audience as compared to the total number of profiles in your account The percentage change in audience size over the last 7 and last 30 days Activity trend (graph of audience size over the defined date range) Activity Graph After creating a new audience, the audience size graph will begin to populate within a day. Depending on the date range you specify, the activity graph can be viewed using following intervals: Hourly Daily Weekly Monthly Audience Size Trends 📘 The statistics for audience size start from the creation date of the audience. Keep in mind that audiences are real-time. This makes them quite different from the user lists in other marketing tools which are frozen in time and only change when you update the list. Audiences are filters applied to the total audience and will change whenever a user's behavior changes in a way that will add or remove them from the audience definition. In this way, tracking audience size over time is a powerful reporting tool. For example, you create an audience that contains users who have visited the international news section of your website. Upon creation the audience contains 120,000 users. You then run a marketing campaign promoting your international news section. After one week, the audience has grown from 120,000 to 400,000 users with most of the growth occurring in the 24 hours after the campaign was launched. This is clear evidence that the campaign was effective, and most effective in the first 24 hours, at driving users to your international news section.s Audience Details Select the Details tab to view the following sections: Exports : This section outlines what exports (if any) are using this audience Recent Users : This section allows you to view a sample of users in this audience who have been active recently (by clicking the View button) Audience Characteristics Select the Characteristics tab to view the characteristics of users in this audience. Characteristics include: Behavior Web Activity Content Affinity Campaign Referral Interactions Audience Logs Select the Logs tab to view recent events relating to this audience. Activity such as creation, updating and syncing can all be found here. Activating Audiences Activating Audiences in Experiences Creating a Lytics Experience is one of the easiest and most common ways to activate Lytics Audiences. Learn more about Lytics Experiences to find out how you can engage your audiences on site. Accessing Audiences Using the Public Entity API The Lytics Experience Editor is a great way to get started with website personalization, but through the use of the Lytics API, there is much more that can be done. The Lytics Experience editor is powered by the Pathfora SDK which is in turn powered by the Lytics Entity API. The Lytics Entity API is how to find out what audiences the current user belongs to as well as what traits the user has. Using the Lytics Entity API it's possible to create completely custom personalized experiences on your site. 📘 Personalizing a site using the Public Entity API requires making code changes to the host website. To read more about the Entity API, check out the API documentation . Exporting Audiences to Other Tools A core benefit of Lytics is exporting your smart audiences to the other tools in your marketing tech stack. That way, the campaigns run on your channels are enriched with the behavioral data and content affinities powered by data science on Lytics. From the audience overview page, click the Export button to create a new export job . The Export menu lists built in exports such as Email CSV and any out of the box Integrations. Specific instructions for exporting can be found in the Integrations section (under the desired tool) of our documentation. Updated 4 months ago",

Lytics makes it easy to find these insights so your campaign strategies can be adjusted accordingly. Audiences can be used in Lytics Experiences, third-party ad campaigns, and tools like Google BigQuery for advanced reporting. When all of that isn’t enough, the Lytics APIs provide deep integrations with the Lytics platform. 📘 Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences . Once on the Audiences page, click on the + Create New Audience button. Creating Audiences Building new audiences allows you to target specific groups of your users. Why send the same email to your entire audience? Instead, send emails to distinct audiences with content that you know those users enjoy. Lytics gives you the ability to create audiences based on cross channel user data, behaviors and interests. Audiences can be built using existing audiences, user content affinity, your personalization campaigns, or by custom rules utilizing any user fields in your Lytics account. Create rulesets by combining multiple audiences and boolean logic to target users with as much or as little granularity as you require. Lytics updates your audiences automatically. Once an audience is built, users will join or leave whenever they match (or fail to match) the rules you have set. Export your audiences, often in real-time, to your integrated marketing tools giving you the power of Lytics however you engage with your users. 📘 Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences . Once on the Audiences page, click on the + Create New Audience button. Building Audiences: Existing Audiences The Existing Audiences tab in the audience builder contains a list of all existing audiences and their size categorized by audience type such as characteristic. Characteristics are pre-built audiences pertaining to single user attributes such as location or behavior. Keep in mind that the audience sizes you see in this list are not real-time. They are updated every few hours for performance reasons. When creating or editing an audience, however, you will always see real-time numbers so that you can make precise decisions based on accurate data. You can use the Filter by Audience Type drop-down to filter the list or use the Search box to quickly find an audience by name. Select an audience or characteristic to add it to the definition of the audience you are building or editing. Building Audiences: Content Affinity The Content Affinity tab in the audience builder is used to add Affinity-based rules to your audience. Since Affinities are a group of related Topics , this allows you to effectively target users interested in several subjects or products. In the example above, we created a \"Lavender\" Affinity for an online beauty store, which includes 6 Topics such as \"lavender\", \"lavender lotion\", and \"lavender luxury.\" Instead of creating an audience with 6 rules (one per Topic), we just select our Lavender Affinity that contains those 6 Topics. Once you choose an Affinity for your audience, you will be able to select the range of affinity values. The histogram displays the distribution of user interest for the selected Affinity and is helpful to build an audience that has the desired size. By default, users with Any Affinity are selected. You can choose a built-in range by clicking any of the Affinity buttons or, to set a custom range, use the slider to refine the range of users to target. As you change the range, the total number of users that fit the range is shown in the right column. As soon as you create an Affinity, Lytics start scoring users against it as they interact with your content or products. For active users, you can expect this number to start populating within a few days. For inactive users, it can take up to 2 weeks for them to be scored against an Affinity. So it's recommended that you create Affinities in advance of the audience needed for an Affinity-based campaign. Topic-Based Audiences Under the Custom Rule tab in the Audience Builder, you can find the existing audiences based on Topics in your content taxonomy. If you want to create new audiences based on a single Topic, you can do so as follows: Search for \"Topics\" in the Custom Rule tab of the Audience Builder Select the Topic of interest. Set the threshold according to the desired users' level of interest in that Topic. Once you hit \"Add Condition\", the custom rule for a Topic will look like this: Although Topics are still supported in the Audience Builder, we strongly recommend you use Affinities to build audiences for a more efficient workflow and more effective targeting. Inferred Content Affinity Some users may find a field named Inferred Content Affinity when trying to build affinity or topic based audiences. This field contains topics that a user could be interested in even though they may not have interacted with the topics directly. To learn more about how these inferrences are made, you can read about our content taxonomy process . Note that topic affinity already includes this information, but this field contains only inferred affinity. We would also recommend not using this field to build audiences as it is not a wholistic view of a user's affinity. Building Audiences: Custom Rules The Custom Rules tab in the audience builder is used to add any rule based on a user field to the audience being built or edited. Custom rules allow for ultimate access of all data that is aggregated in user fields. Custom rules are simple statements that can be combined to create very precise audiences. Using them correctly requires a thorough understanding of the data being used, but there is no replacement for this level of segmentation. 🚧 Audiences Field Value Limits Audiences can have a maximum of 1,000 field values. \"Values\" in this context apply to a single evaluation against a user field. When exceeded, the error message \"Audience too large! Remove values to save this audience\" will be displayed. For example, the following scenarios would trigger the alert: An audience with a single rule that supports multiple values ( e.g. contains one of) with 1001+ values. An audience with 1001+ user field rules each with a single evaluation (e.g. exists). Any variation in between such as two rules each containing over 500 evaluations, etc. The user field list displays all the fields in your account. The Source drop-down can be used to filter on the data stream the user field came from. The Includes drop-down can be used to filter user fields on the percentage of users that have a field. Use the Search input to search for a user field by name. Generally, to add a Custom Rule to an audience definition: Choose a User Field Choose an operator (e.g., text contains, value is less than) Choose a value There are variations to this general procedure based on the type of the user field and the operator chosen. User Field Types How you work with user fields in the Custom Rules tab will depend on way the field is mapped in on the user profile. Numeric User Fields Numeric user fields are most commonly used for data that is counted. For instance, the number of times a visitor has been to a website or the number of times a subscriber has opened an email. Exact values can be matched, but more commonly, inequalities are expressed. Examples: Total Number of Visits must equal 5: Any user who has visited 4 times, 6 times, or any number of times other than 5 will not be matched by this rule. Total Number of Visits must be less than 3: Any user who has visited 0, 1, or 2 times will be matched by this rule. Text User Fields Text User fields are commonly used for words and miscellaneous information. For instance, a user’s first name. Since there is no mathematical relationship between two text values, the operations used are generally exact match or partial match. There are 5 operator options when making audiences with text user fields: Equal : The value for the field you want the audience to have. Format and character spacing for the value must match exactly what is in the data stream. You can select the value by interacting with the visualization or be promoted with available values by typing into the search bar. Contain : The text entered (case sensitive and exact order) appears within a value for the field. Be Like : Use the wildcard character * along with text to decide the parts of values you want to match. E.g., test will only match on the exact string test, while test* will match strings starting with test, such as \"testing\", and *test* will match any string that has test in it, such as \"my test case\". Equal one of : Add each, exact value you want included individually. A new search bar will appear after each selection. You can remove values from the list using the “x” to the left of the value. The logic for each of these rules follows the logic from “Equal”. Exist : Excludes everyone that does not have a value for the field. Examples First Name must equal Ash: Only users named Ash will be matched. First name must contain Ash: Any user named Ash will be matched. Additionally, anyone named Ashley, Ashton, or any other name that has the letters \"Ash\" next to each other will be matched. Dash or Natasha will NOT be matched - as these do not have an “A.” To make an audience that includes these, create a second rule set for “First name must contain ash.” Date User Fields Date user fields are commonly used for any data that represents a point in time. For instance, the last time a user visited a website. Most commonly, a date is chosen to divide the people who fall before or after that date. You will need to select both your starting point and a direction in time for your custom rule. Your starting point could be a fixed point in time (useful for milestone events, like product launches) or a relative point in time (useful for scheduled follow ups). Since each rule only handles going forward or backward from a single point in time, you may need to create two rules that work together to bound a range of time. One rule will capture all dates after the first point in time, and a second rule will capture all dates before a later point in time. Some date fields have a natural boundary, such as Last Visits, which will never include a date in the future. If you want all Last Visits from a point in time up until now, you would only need to create one rule. Examples Last Visit must be Before June 22, 2016: Created by selecting Specific Date and the direction Before . This rule includes only users who have not visited since the 22nd of June. Last Visit must be After 3 days in the past: Created by selecting Relative Date , entering 3 days In the past and selecting the direction After . This rule includes only users who have visited in the last three days. Subscription End Date must be within the next 30 days: Created by building two rules: one to set the start date to always be the current date and the other to set the end date to 30 days in the future relative to the current date. Create the first rule by selecting Relative Date , After , entering 0 Days , selecting In the past , and clicking Add Condition . Create the second rule by selecting Relative Date , Before , 30 Days , In the future , and clicking Add Condition . This audience will now include all users who have a subscription ending in the next 30 days beginning with the current date. Set User Fields Set user fields are commonly used for collecting related data over time. For instance, all the URLs a user has visited. These fields are generally used much like text user fields, even though the data is structured differently. Examples All URL Paths Ever must contain one of /blog , /products , or /about : Any user who has visited any one of these three paths will be matched. Followed Sports must contain Baseball: Any user who follows Baseball will be matched. This is true whether they only follow Baseball or follow Baseball in addition to Football, Hockey, and Bowling. Map/Nested User Fields Map user fields are used to add hierarchy to a dynamic domain of data. For instance, Events By Device is a count of all events, but grouped by each device. So instead of building a rule by only specifying the count, the rule is built by first specifying the device, then the count. The device could be thought of as an additional, dynamic user field that is nested under the map user field. Selecting a Key When using a map user field, the first step is selecting the dynamic user field to build a rule with, called a key . Using the URLs Visited example, the keys could include any numeric value. Since these keys are dynamic,  counts will be updated automatically. Building the Condition Once a key is selected a condition is built. The type of the nested user field is called the value type . In the case of URLs Visited , the value type is numeric. When building audiences with nested fields, the visualization chart will not display for mapped fields to minimize page load times. Examples Events By Device (Desktop) must be greater than 5: Only users who have visited the website more than 5 times on a desktop will be matched. If a user has visited more than 5 times on the mobile web, they will not be matched. Signup Date for Event (Personalization Webinar) must be within the last 7 days: Only the users who signed up for the Personalization Webinar in the last week will be matched. Users who signed up more than 7 days ago will not be matched. Users who signed up for a different event in the last 7 days will also not be matched. Out of the Box Custom Rules Some user fields are mapped by default and populated through the use of the Lytics Javascript tag and Experiences. These out of the box fields can be incredibly useful when building audiences using Custom Rules. Lytics Javascript Tag Assuming that you have not made changes to the 'default' web LQL file that is automatically created when the Lytics Javascript Tag is installed, the following custom rules are available to you for use when building audiences. Rule Description All channels used (web, email, etc.) All the channels a user has been active in based on the data imported into your Lytics account. Bot The Lytics JavaScript Tag captures information from the web browser to determine if the user is bot or not. When data is collected from the Lytics JavaScript Tag, that request will include the user-agent of the client that was used to initiate the request. The user agent is parsed and evaluated using a third party library . That evaluation determines if the request is from a \"bot\" or not. NOTE : The third party library does not capture all bots. Created Timestamp The timestamp of when a user profile was created. When an anonymous and known profile is merged the oldest timestamp is retained. Devices Used Any devices a user has used e.g. desktop, Android, iOS. Event First Time Seen Captures the timestamp of the first event sent through from your website by either your tag manager or the Lytics JavaScript Tag, along with some details around what that event was. Event Last Time Seen Captures the timestamp of the last event sent through from your website from either your tag manager or our Lytics JavaScript Tag, along with some details around what that event was. Last Active The last timestamp on the profile that indicated activity on web or any connected sources importing activity data to your account. Last Activity by Channel The last timestamp on the profile that indicated activity on a particular channel. Last Visit City Pulled from visit_city field from your Default (web) source and indicates the last value seen. Last Visit Country Pulled from visit_country field from your Default (web) source and indicates the last value seen. Last Visit State/Province Pulled from visit_region field from your Default (web) source and indicated last value seen. Modified Timestamp The last time that a profile was updated. Random, uniform partition of users Every profile in Lytics is assigned a random number between 1-",
      "By using this rule, you can perform simple A/B tests to decrease the size of an audience for testing down to a certain percentage of the total audience size. Read more about simple AB testing. Score Frequency, Intensity, Momentum, Propensity, Quntatiy, or Recency. The values of the user's Lytics behavorial scores. See Lytics Scores for detailed descriptions of these fields. Time of First Visit The time of a user’s first visit to your website since the Lytics JavaScript Tag was installed. Time of Last Visit The time of a user’s last website visit. Timezone The timezone they are in based on their last web session. Total Number of Visits Total number of different times a user has come to your website. Total Pageview Count A user’s lifetime total of pageviews. User Agent The last browser user agent of the user e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge. Web Cookie ID(current) The cookie id of the last session a user had on your website. Web Cookie IDs(all) All of the cookie ids tied to a user. Web Domains Visited All the domains a user has visited that have the Lytics JavaScript Tag installed. Web Events by Hour Number of tracked events for each hour of the day in 24 hour UTC time . Web Events by Week Number of tracked events for each hour in a week. Experiences There are a variety of use cases that involve targeting users who have engaged with previous marketing campaigns. For example, if a user converted on an Iterable Experience email, and you want to follow up with an SMS message. The steps below will walk you through how to create an audience to target users who were reached by or clicked on an Experience . Navigate to Experiences and search for the one you would like to use. You will need to get an ID for the Experience, which differs depending on the Experience type: For Lytics Web Personalization Experiences : Look up the URL for this Experience and locate the long string of numbers of letters as highlighted below. Save this to your clipboard. For all other Experience types : open developer tools and navigate to the “Network” tab. Refresh the page and filter the requests by “experience”. Find the response that looks similar to the example below, and save the external_id value (nested under vehicle ) to your clipboard. Note: You can also use the Experience API to fetch the current Experience by ID to get the full payload, including the Experience's external_id . In your Lytics account, navigate to Audiences > Create New Audience . In the audience builder, select Custom Rule and search for the provider of the Experience you would like to segment on. After you enter a provider, you should see a field for conversions and reach on those Experience types. Select the action you wish to segment off of. Copy and paste the ID you copied from step 2 into the text box. Choose Exist as your operator and add the condition to your audience. Select Add Condition . You now have an audience based on past interactions with an Experience. You can save the audience as is, or continue to add rules based on your use case. Building Audiences: Multiple Rules and Rule Sets All audience definitions are comprised of rules based on existing audiences , content affinity , campaigns , and custom rules . You may have noticed that after you add your first rule in the audience builder you have the option to Add New Rule or Add New Rule Set . Adding new rules and rulesets, and setting the conditions for their interaction, gives you the ability to refine which users your audiences target. Working With Multiple Rules This audience has a single rule: included all users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers . This will select all users with an intensity score of 20 or less but with a frequency score of 20 or greater. These are users who interact often but not on a deep level. You can refine this rule further by clicking Add New Rule . This audience now also includes a rule for users who have a low content affinity for Technology content. Now that it has been added, there are three numbers of interest. The first number, 87,650, is the number of users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers . The second number, 466,730, is the number of users who have low affinity for Technology content. The third number, 11,514, are the users who meet both of these conditions. Clicking the And/Or toggle, will switch the way the two rules intereact. The audience now includes all 542,921 users who either have the characteristic Behavior: Perusers or have low afffinity for Technology content. Excluding Rules In addition to the And/Or toggle, there is the Included/Excluded toggle. This toggle inverts a condition. This audience contains a rule that targets the 159,084 users with the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile or users who have used a mobile devices. Clicking the Include/Exclude toggle the audience will now target the 705,166 users who do not have the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile . The sum of the two numbers will be the total audience size that meets those rule(s). This is especially apparent when using a rule such as Created Timestamp Exists . Every user in Lytics will have a timestamp of when they were created. Therefore, the number of users who do not meet the condition of having a created timestamp will always be",
      "Working With Rule Sets When building elaborate audiences, having a single set of rules that are evaluated using either an AND or an OR is not enough. A ruleset is a set of rules that itself can be used as a rule for an even larger set of rules that is again evaluated using an AND or an OR . This audience has two rulesets. The first ruleset has one rule: all users who have the characteristic Email Capture Status: Known Email . The second ruleset has two rules: all users have some affinity for Marketing OR Advertising content. Combining these two rulesets with the AND operator produces an audience that targets users with an email address that have some interest in either marketing or advertising. This audience could be used to email a special newsletter or promotion about a product or trending topic that is related to marketing or advertising. Excluding Rule Sets Rulesets, just like rules, can be excluded. Clicking the Include/Exclude toogle on the second ruleset will result in the audience targeting all users with an email address who do not have some interest in either marketing or advertising. It could be used to send a different email to the remainder of your users with email addresses. Building Audiences: Configuration Options Configure your Lytics audiences with the following options to execute your use cases. Enabling API Access By default, newly created Lytics audiences are not enabled for API access and thus will not be available to public APIs. Enabling API access is necessary when integrating with other client-side tags/ pixels, Pathfora , or the Lytics personalization API endpoints. Select the API Accessible checkbox to enable access. Generate Insights Lytics Insights provide visibility into the performance of your audiences and campaigns as users interact with your brand. Insights are generated out-of-the-box for Lytics Behavioral and Engagement audiences. You can also request up to 10 custom audiences to be prioritized as candidates for generating Insights. When creating a new audience or editing an existing one, select the Generate Insights checkbox to make that audience a candidate for Insights (shown in the screenshot above). Lytics prioritizes Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences for your account. Therefore, even if you select the \"Generate Insights\" option for a particular audience, it is not guaranteed to show up in your Insights drawer. Managing Audiences Managing audiences becomes important as an account develops and your user base grows. Audiences are critical to both targeted campaigns as well as discovering insights about your users. The Audiences section of Lytics houses all of your account’s audiences. You can view, create, and manage audiences from this section. Audiences are listed alphabetically by default. Click any column header to change the sort property. Common sort options are Last Modified and Size (the number of users in the audience). Naming Your Audiences For better targeting, Lytics encourages the creation of many audiences. They’re easy and free to make. When working with a large library of audiences, naming conventions become important. Name your audiences by purpose and include any categorization in the name. Giving them a common prefix (e.g., Holiday Promo: Tech lovers, Holiday Promo: Loyal Shoppers) will help you to keep everything related next to each other in the user interface. Audiences appear throughout the Lytics platform. Make sure your naming convention works in any context to avoid confusion. Finding Audiences The easiest way to find an audience is to use the Search box. As you enter your search term the audience list will display any matching audiences. 📘 Fuzzy matching is used to search for audiences so the results will not be an exact match to the search term. Editing Audiences Occasionally you will want to return to previously created audiences and update the logic used to create the segment. Find the audience you would like to edit Click on the audience to navigate to the overview of the audience Click the Edit button to enter the audience builder Make your desired changes within the audience builder Click Save 🚧 When editing audiences that are in an active triggered workflow, it is recommended that you reconfigure the job after the audience changes have been made. Duplicating Audiences Find the audience you would like to duplicate Click on the audience to navigate to the overview of the audience Click the ... button to enter the audience builder. The audience builder will be pre-populated with all of the criteria of the audience you duplicated. Make any desired changes Click Save 🚧 Audiences created by duplication will retain the name and slug of the duplicated audience, but with have \"duplicate\" appended at the end. It is recommended that you update both the name and manually input a unique slug name for clarity sake. Deleting Audiences Deleting audiences is an integral part to keeping a tidy workspace in Lytics. Audiences can be deleted in one of two ways: individually or in batch. Note: Deleting an audience does not delete the users associated with that audience. Deleting an Individual Audience From the Browse Audiences list, select the name of the audience you wish to delete. From the options menu, select Delete . Click Delete . Click Accept to confirm. Deleting Multiple Audiences From the Browse Audiences list, select the checkboxes of the audiences you wish to delete. NOTE: Audience selection persists when changing pages allowing you to select audiences from multiple pages. Click Delete Selected Audiences . Click Delete . NOTE: Lytics will check to see if the audiences you selected are safe to delete. Audiences are considered safe if they are not used in an ongoing export, campaign, or another audience's definition. You will be prompted to delete dependant audiences, click Yes to delete the selected audience and any dependants listed or Skip cancel deletion of the selected audience. Click Accept to confirm. Maintaining Audiences 📘 From the Audiences page, click any audience in the list to view all of its details. An audience's landing page contains a lot of valuable information about your users and the audience itself. At the top of the audience page, you will find the following information... Audience name ID Slug Created by Created on date Last updated date API access configuration Below this information you will find multiple tabs where you can access additional information about the audience. Audience Summary The audience summary page is designed to provide insights into the current state of an audience as well as how the audience has changed over time. When first navigating to an audience landing page, this tab will be selected by default. The Summary tab includes the following sections: General Metrics The total number of users in this audience The total percentage of this audience as compared to the total number of profiles in your account The percentage change in audience size over the last 7 and last 30 days Activity trend (graph of audience size over the defined date range) Activity Graph After creating a new audience, the audience size graph will begin to populate within a day. Depending on the date range you specify, the activity graph can be viewed using following intervals: Hourly Daily Weekly Monthly Audience Size Trends 📘 The statistics for audience size start from the creation date of the audience. Keep in mind that audiences are real-time. This makes them quite different from the user lists in other marketing tools which are frozen in time and only change when you update the list. Audiences are filters applied to the total audience and will change whenever a user's behavior changes in a way that will add or remove them from the audience definition. In this way, tracking audience size over time is a powerful reporting tool. For example, you create an audience that contains users who have visited the international news section of your website. Upon creation the audience contains 120,000 users. You then run a marketing campaign promoting your international news section. After one week, the audience has grown from 120,000 to 400,000 users with most of the growth occurring in the 24 hours after the campaign was launched. This is clear evidence that the campaign was effective, and most effective in the first 24 hours, at driving users to your international news section.s Audience Details Select the Details tab to view the following sections: Exports : This section outlines what exports (if any) are using this audience Recent Users : This section allows you to view a sample of users in this audience who have been active recently (by clicking the View button) Audience Characteristics Select the Characteristics tab to view the characteristics of users in this audience. Characteristics include: Behavior Web Activity Content Affinity Campaign Referral Interactions Audience Logs Select the Logs tab to view recent events relating to this audience. Activity such as creation, updating and syncing can all be found here. Activating Audiences Activating Audiences in Experiences Creating a Lytics Experience is one of the easiest and most common ways to activate Lytics Audiences. Learn more about Lytics Experiences to find out how you can engage your audiences on site. Accessing Audiences Using the Public Entity API The Lytics Experience Editor is a great way to get started with website personalization, but through the use of the Lytics API, there is much more that can be done. The Lytics Experience editor is powered by the Pathfora SDK which is in turn powered by the Lytics Entity API. The Lytics Entity API is how to find out what audiences the current user belongs to as well as what traits the user has. Using the Lytics Entity API it's possible to create completely custom personalized experiences on your site. 📘 Personalizing a site using the Public Entity API requires making code changes to the host website. To read more about the Entity API, check out the API documentation . Exporting Audiences to Other Tools A core benefit of Lytics is exporting your smart audiences to the other tools in your marketing tech stack. That way, the campaigns run on your channels are enriched with the behavioral data and content affinities powered by data science on Lytics. From the audience overview page, click the Export button to create a new export job . The Export menu lists built in exports such as Email CSV and any out of the box Integrations. Specific instructions for exporting can be found in the Integrations section (under the desired tool) of our documentation. Updated 4 months ago",
      "along with text to decide the parts of values you want to match. E.g., test will only match on the exact string test, while test",
      "will match strings starting with test, such as \"testing\", and",
      "will match any string that has test in it, such as \"my test case\". Equal one of : Add each, exact value you want included individually. A new search bar will appear after each selection. You can remove values from the list using the “x” to the left of the value. The logic for each of these rules follows the logic from “Equal”. Exist : Excludes everyone that does not have a value for the field. Examples First Name must equal Ash: Only users named Ash will be matched. First name must contain Ash: Any user named Ash will be matched. Additionally, anyone named Ashley, Ashton, or any other name that has the letters \"Ash\" next to each other will be matched. Dash or Natasha will NOT be matched",
      "as these do not have an “A.” To make an audience that includes these, create a second rule set for “First name must contain ash.” Date User Fields Date user fields are commonly used for any data that represents a point in time. For instance, the last time a user visited a website. Most commonly, a date is chosen to divide the people who fall before or after that date. You will need to select both your starting point and a direction in time for your custom rule. Your starting point could be a fixed point in time (useful for milestone events, like product launches) or a relative point in time (useful for scheduled follow ups). Since each rule only handles going forward or backward from a single point in time, you may need to create two rules that work together to bound a range of time. One rule will capture all dates after the first point in time, and a second rule will capture all dates before a later point in time. Some date fields have a natural boundary, such as Last Visits, which will never include a date in the future. If you want all Last Visits from a point in time up until now, you would only need to create one rule. Examples Last Visit must be Before June 22, 2016: Created by selecting Specific Date and the direction Before . This rule includes only users who have not visited since the 22nd of June. Last Visit must be After 3 days in the past: Created by selecting Relative Date , entering 3 days In the past and selecting the direction After . This rule includes only users who have visited in the last three days. Subscription End Date must be within the next 30 days: Created by building two rules: one to set the start date to always be the current date and the other to set the end date to 30 days in the future relative to the current date. Create the first rule by selecting Relative Date , After , entering 0 Days , selecting In the past , and clicking Add Condition . Create the second rule by selecting Relative Date , Before , 30 Days , In the future , and clicking Add Condition . This audience will now include all users who have a subscription ending in the next 30 days beginning with the current date. Set User Fields Set user fields are commonly used for collecting related data over time. For instance, all the URLs a user has visited. These fields are generally used much like text user fields, even though the data is structured differently. Examples All URL Paths Ever must contain one of /blog , /products , or /about : Any user who has visited any one of these three paths will be matched. Followed Sports must contain Baseball: Any user who follows Baseball will be matched. This is true whether they only follow Baseball or follow Baseball in addition to Football, Hockey, and Bowling. Map/Nested User Fields Map user fields are used to add hierarchy to a dynamic domain of data. For instance, Events By Device is a count of all events, but grouped by each device. So instead of building a rule by only specifying the count, the rule is built by first specifying the device, then the count. The device could be thought of as an additional, dynamic user field that is nested under the map user field. Selecting a Key When using a map user field, the first step is selecting the dynamic user field to build a rule with, called a key . Using the URLs Visited example, the keys could include any numeric value. Since these keys are dynamic,  counts will be updated automatically. Building the Condition Once a key is selected a condition is built. The type of the nested user field is called the value type . In the case of URLs Visited , the value type is numeric. When building audiences with nested fields, the visualization chart will not display for mapped fields to minimize page load times. Examples Events By Device (Desktop) must be greater than 5: Only users who have visited the website more than 5 times on a desktop will be matched. If a user has visited more than 5 times on the mobile web, they will not be matched. Signup Date for Event (Personalization Webinar) must be within the last 7 days: Only the users who signed up for the Personalization Webinar in the last week will be matched. Users who signed up more than 7 days ago will not be matched. Users who signed up for a different event in the last 7 days will also not be matched. Out of the Box Custom Rules Some user fields are mapped by default and populated through the use of the Lytics Javascript tag and Experiences. These out of the box fields can be incredibly useful when building audiences using Custom Rules. Lytics Javascript Tag Assuming that you have not made changes to the 'default' web LQL file that is automatically created when the Lytics Javascript Tag is installed, the following custom rules are available to you for use when building audiences. Rule Description All channels used (web, email, etc.) All the channels a user has been active in based on the data imported into your Lytics account. Bot The Lytics JavaScript Tag captures information from the web browser to determine if the user is bot or not.

    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Introduction Audiences are central to creating personalized marketing using Lytics. It is how groups of users get targeted and defines how cross-channel user data is used in campaigns. Lytics offers audiences as a tool that operates on user fields as well as other audiences. This provides the ability to craft audiences that target one user, every user, or any number in between. Lytics audiences are automatically kept up to date. As time passes, an audience that once targeted 500 users may grow to target 10,000. This is great if your audience is targeting engaged users who have shown interest in your upcoming product, but not so great if your audience targets users with outstanding support tickets. Lytics makes it easy to find these insights so your campaign strategies can be adjusted accordingly. Audiences can be used in Lytics Experiences, third-party ad campaigns, and tools like Google BigQuery for advanced reporting. When all of that isn’t enough, the Lytics APIs provide deep integrations with the Lytics platform. 📘 Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences . Once on the Audiences page, click on the + Create New Audience button. Creating Audiences Building new audiences allows you to target specific groups of your users. Why send the same email to your entire audience? Instead, send emails to distinct audiences with content that you know those users enjoy. Lytics gives you the ability to create audiences based on cross channel user data, behaviors and interests. Audiences can be built using existing audiences, user content affinity, your personalization campaigns, or by custom rules utilizing any user fields in your Lytics account. Create rulesets by combining multiple audiences and boolean logic to target users with as much or as little granularity as you require. Lytics updates your audiences automatically. Once an audience is built, users will join or leave whenever they match (or fail to match) the rules you have set. Export your audiences, often in real-time, to your integrated marketing tools giving you the power of Lytics however you engage with your users. 📘 Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences . Once on the Audiences page, click on the + Create New Audience button. Building Audiences: Existing Audiences The Existing Audiences tab in the audience builder contains a list of all existing audiences and their size categorized by audience type such as characteristic. Characteristics are pre-built audiences pertaining to single user attributes such as location or behavior. Keep in mind that the audience sizes you see in this list are not real-time. They are updated every few hours for performance reasons. When creating or editing an audience, however, you will always see real-time numbers so that you can make precise decisions based on accurate data. You can use the Filter by Audience Type drop-down to filter the list or use the Search box to quickly find an audience by name. Select an audience or characteristic to add it to the definition of the audience you are building or editing. Building Audiences: Content Affinity The Content Affinity tab in the audience builder is used to add Affinity-based rules to your audience. Since Affinities are a group of related Topics , this allows you to effectively target users interested in several subjects or products. In the example above, we created a \"Lavender\" Affinity for an online beauty store, which includes 6 Topics such as \"lavender\", \"lavender lotion\", and \"lavender luxury.\" Instead of creating an audience with 6 rules (one per Topic), we just select our Lavender Affinity that contains those 6 Topics. Once you choose an Affinity for your audience, you will be able to select the range of affinity values. The histogram displays the distribution of user interest for the selected Affinity and is helpful to build an audience that has the desired size. By default, users with Any Affinity are selected. You can choose a built-in range by clicking any of the Affinity buttons or, to set a custom range, use the slider to refine the range of users to target. As you change the range, the total number of users that fit the range is shown in the right column. As soon as you create an Affinity, Lytics start scoring users against it as they interact with your content or products. For active users, you can expect this number to start populating within a few days. For inactive users, it can take up to 2 weeks for them to be scored against an Affinity. So it's recommended that you create Affinities in advance of the audience needed for an Affinity-based campaign. Topic-Based Audiences Under the Custom Rule tab in the Audience Builder, you can find the existing audiences based on Topics in your content taxonomy. If you want to create new audiences based on a single Topic, you can do so as follows: Search for \"Topics\" in the Custom Rule tab of the Audience Builder Select the Topic of interest. Set the threshold according to the desired users' level of interest in that Topic. Once you hit \"Add Condition\", the custom rule for a Topic will look like this: Although Topics are still supported in the Audience Builder, we strongly recommend you use Affinities to build audiences for a more efficient workflow and more effective targeting. Inferred Content Affinity Some users may find a field named Inferred Content Affinity when trying to build affinity or topic based audiences. This field contains topics that a user could be interested in even though they may not have interacted with the topics directly. To learn more about how these inferrences are made, you can read about our content taxonomy process . Note that topic affinity already includes this information, but this field contains only inferred affinity. We would also recommend not using this field to build audiences as it is not a wholistic view of a user's affinity. Building Audiences: Custom Rules The Custom Rules tab in the audience builder is used to add any rule based on a user field to the audience being built or edited. Custom rules allow for ultimate access of all data that is aggregated in user fields. Custom rules are simple statements that can be combined to create very precise audiences. Using them correctly requires a thorough understanding of the data being used, but there is no replacement for this level of segmentation. 🚧 Audiences Field Value Limits Audiences can have a maximum of 1,000 field values. \"Values\" in this context apply to a single evaluation against a user field. When exceeded, the error message \"Audience too large! Remove values to save this audience\" will be displayed. For example, the following scenarios would trigger the alert: An audience with a single rule that supports multiple values ( e.g. contains one of) with 1001+ values. An audience with 1001+ user field rules each with a single evaluation (e.g. exists). Any variation in between such as two rules each containing over 500 evaluations, etc. The user field list displays all the fields in your account. The Source drop-down can be used to filter on the data stream the user field came from. The Includes drop-down can be used to filter user fields on the percentage of users that have a field. Use the Search input to search for a user field by name. Generally, to add a Custom Rule to an audience definition: Choose a User Field Choose an operator (e.g., text contains, value is less than) Choose a value There are variations to this general procedure based on the type of the user field and the operator chosen. User Field Types How you work with user fields in the Custom Rules tab will depend on way the field is mapped in on the user profile. Numeric User Fields Numeric user fields are most commonly used for data that is counted. For instance, the number of times a visitor has been to a website or the number of times a subscriber has opened an email. Exact values can be matched, but more commonly, inequalities are expressed. Examples: Total Number of Visits must equal 5: Any user who has visited 4 times, 6 times, or any number of times other than 5 will not be matched by this rule. Total Number of Visits must be less than 3: Any user who has visited 0, 1, or 2 times will be matched by this rule. Text User Fields Text User fields are commonly used for words and miscellaneous information. For instance, a user’s first name. Since there is no mathematical relationship between two text values, the operations used are generally exact match or partial match. There are 5 operator options when making audiences with text user fields: Equal : The value for the field you want the audience to have. Format and character spacing for the value must match exactly what is in the data stream. You can select the value by interacting with the visualization or be promoted with available values by typing into the search bar. Contain : The text entered (case sensitive and exact order) appears within a value for the field. Be Like : Use the wildcard character * along with text to decide the parts of values you want to match. E.g., test will only match on the exact string test, while test* will match strings starting with test, such as \"testing\", and *test* will match any string that has test in it, such as \"my test case\". Equal one of : Add each, exact value you want included individually. A new search bar will appear after each selection. You can remove values from the list using the “x” to the left of the value. The logic for each of these rules follows the logic from “Equal”. Exist : Excludes everyone that does not have a value for the field. Examples First Name must equal Ash: Only users named Ash will be matched. First name must contain Ash: Any user named Ash will be matched. Additionally, anyone named Ashley, Ashton, or any other name that has the letters \"Ash\" next to each other will be matched. Dash or Natasha will NOT be matched - as these do not have an “A.” To make an audience that includes these, create a second rule set for “First name must contain ash.” Date User Fields Date user fields are commonly used for any data that represents a point in time. For instance, the last time a user visited a website. Most commonly, a date is chosen to divide the people who fall before or after that date. You will need to select both your starting point and a direction in time for your custom rule. Your starting point could be a fixed point in time (useful for milestone events, like product launches) or a relative point in time (useful for scheduled follow ups). Since each rule only handles going forward or backward from a single point in time, you may need to create two rules that work together to bound a range of time. One rule will capture all dates after the first point in time, and a second rule will capture all dates before a later point in time. Some date fields have a natural boundary, such as Last Visits, which will never include a date in the future. If you want all Last Visits from a point in time up until now, you would only need to create one rule. Examples Last Visit must be Before June 22, 2016: Created by selecting Specific Date and the direction Before . This rule includes only users who have not visited since the 22nd of June. Last Visit must be After 3 days in the past: Created by selecting Relative Date , entering 3 days In the past and selecting the direction After . This rule includes only users who have visited in the last three days. Subscription End Date must be within the next 30 days: Created by building two rules: one to set the start date to always be the current date and the other to set the end date to 30 days in the future relative to the current date. Create the first rule by selecting Relative Date , After , entering 0 Days , selecting In the past , and clicking Add Condition . Create the second rule by selecting Relative Date , Before , 30 Days , In the future , and clicking Add Condition . This audience will now include all users who have a subscription ending in the next 30 days beginning with the current date. Set User Fields Set user fields are commonly used for collecting related data over time. For instance, all the URLs a user has visited. These fields are generally used much like text user fields, even though the data is structured differently. Examples All URL Paths Ever must contain one of /blog , /products , or /about : Any user who has visited any one of these three paths will be matched. Followed Sports must contain Baseball: Any user who follows Baseball will be matched. This is true whether they only follow Baseball or follow Baseball in addition to Football, Hockey, and Bowling. Map/Nested User Fields Map user fields are used to add hierarchy to a dynamic domain of data. For instance, Events By Device is a count of all events, but grouped by each device. So instead of building a rule by only specifying the count, the rule is built by first specifying the device, then the count. The device could be thought of as an additional, dynamic user field that is nested under the map user field. Selecting a Key When using a map user field, the first step is selecting the dynamic user field to build a rule with, called a key . Using the URLs Visited example, the keys could include any numeric value. Since these keys are dynamic,  counts will be updated automatically. Building the Condition Once a key is selected a condition is built. The type of the nested user field is called the value type . In the case of URLs Visited , the value type is numeric. When building audiences with nested fields, the visualization chart will not display for mapped fields to minimize page load times. Examples Events By Device (Desktop) must be greater than 5: Only users who have visited the website more than 5 times on a desktop will be matched. If a user has visited more than 5 times on the mobile web, they will not be matched. Signup Date for Event (Personalization Webinar) must be within the last 7 days: Only the users who signed up for the Personalization Webinar in the last week will be matched. Users who signed up more than 7 days ago will not be matched. Users who signed up for a different event in the last 7 days will also not be matched. Out of the Box Custom Rules Some user fields are mapped by default and populated through the use of the Lytics Javascript tag and Experiences. These out of the box fields can be incredibly useful when building audiences using Custom Rules. Lytics Javascript Tag Assuming that you have not made changes to the 'default' web LQL file that is automatically created when the Lytics Javascript Tag is installed, the following custom rules are available to you for use when building audiences. Rule Description All channels used (web, email, etc.) All the channels a user has been active in based on the data imported into your Lytics account. Bot The Lytics JavaScript Tag captures information from the web browser to determine if the user is bot or not. When data is collected from the Lytics JavaScript Tag, that request will include the user-agent of the client that was used to initiate the request. The user agent is parsed and evaluated using a third party library . That evaluation determines if the request is from a \"bot\" or not. NOTE : The third party library does not capture all bots. Created Timestamp The timestamp of when a user profile was created. When an anonymous and known profile is merged the oldest timestamp is retained. Devices Used Any devices a user has used e.g. desktop, Android, iOS. Event First Time Seen Captures the timestamp of the first event sent through from your website by either your tag manager or the Lytics JavaScript Tag, along with some details around what that event was. Event Last Time Seen Captures the timestamp of the last event sent through from your website from either your tag manager or our Lytics JavaScript Tag, along with some details around what that event was. Last Active The last timestamp on the profile that indicated activity on web or any connected sources importing activity data to your account. Last Activity by Channel The last timestamp on the profile that indicated activity on a particular channel. Last Visit City Pulled from visit_city field from your Default (web) source and indicates the last value seen. Last Visit Country Pulled from visit_country field from your Default (web) source and indicates the last value seen. Last Visit State/Province Pulled from visit_region field from your Default (web) source and indicated last value seen. Modified Timestamp The last time that a profile was updated. Random, uniform partition of users Every profile in Lytics is assigned a random number between 1-100. By using this rule, you can perform simple A/B tests to decrease the size of an audience for testing down to a certain percentage of the total audience size. Read more about simple AB testing. Score Frequency, Intensity, Momentum, Propensity, Quntatiy, or Recency. The values of the user's Lytics behavorial scores. See Lytics Scores for detailed descriptions of these fields. Time of First Visit The time of a user’s first visit to your website since the Lytics JavaScript Tag was installed. Time of Last Visit The time of a user’s last website visit. Timezone The timezone they are in based on their last web session. Total Number of Visits Total number of different times a user has come to your website. Total Pageview Count A user’s lifetime total of pageviews. User Agent The last browser user agent of the user e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge. Web Cookie ID(current) The cookie id of the last session a user had on your website. Web Cookie IDs(all) All of the cookie ids tied to a user. Web Domains Visited All the domains a user has visited that have the Lytics JavaScript Tag installed. Web Events by Hour Number of tracked events for each hour of the day in 24 hour UTC time . Web Events by Week Number of tracked events for each hour in a week. Experiences There are a variety of use cases that involve targeting users who have engaged with previous marketing campaigns. For example, if a user converted on an Iterable Experience email, and you want to follow up with an SMS message. The steps below will walk you through how to create an audience to target users who were reached by or clicked on an Experience . Navigate to Experiences and search for the one you would like to use. You will need to get an ID for the Experience, which differs depending on the Experience type: For Lytics Web Personalization Experiences : Look up the URL for this Experience and locate the long string of numbers of letters as highlighted below. Save this to your clipboard. For all other Experience types : open developer tools and navigate to the “Network” tab. Refresh the page and filter the requests by “experience”. Find the response that looks similar to the example below, and save the external_id value (nested under vehicle ) to your clipboard. Note: You can also use the Experience API to fetch the current Experience by ID to get the full payload, including the Experience's external_id . In your Lytics account, navigate to Audiences > Create New Audience . In the audience builder, select Custom Rule and search for the provider of the Experience you would like to segment on. After you enter a provider, you should see a field for conversions and reach on those Experience types. Select the action you wish to segment off of. Copy and paste the ID you copied from step 2 into the text box. Choose Exist as your operator and add the condition to your audience. Select Add Condition . You now have an audience based on past interactions with an Experience. You can save the audience as is, or continue to add rules based on your use case. Building Audiences: Multiple Rules and Rule Sets All audience definitions are comprised of rules based on existing audiences , content affinity , campaigns , and custom rules . You may have noticed that after you add your first rule in the audience builder you have the option to Add New Rule or Add New Rule Set . Adding new rules and rulesets, and setting the conditions for their interaction, gives you the ability to refine which users your audiences target. Working With Multiple Rules This audience has a single rule: included all users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers . This will select all users with an intensity score of 20 or less but with a frequency score of 20 or greater. These are users who interact often but not on a deep level. You can refine this rule further by clicking Add New Rule . This audience now also includes a rule for users who have a low content affinity for Technology content. Now that it has been added, there are three numbers of interest. The first number, 87,650, is the number of users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers . The second number, 466,730, is the number of users who have low affinity for Technology content. The third number, 11,514, are the users who meet both of these conditions. Clicking the And/Or toggle, will switch the way the two rules intereact. The audience now includes all 542,921 users who either have the characteristic Behavior: Perusers or have low afffinity for Technology content. Excluding Rules In addition to the And/Or toggle, there is the Included/Excluded toggle. This toggle inverts a condition. This audience contains a rule that targets the 159,084 users with the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile or users who have used a mobile devices. Clicking the Include/Exclude toggle the audience will now target the 705,166 users who do not have the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile . The sum of the two numbers will be the total audience size that meets those rule(s). This is especially apparent when using a rule such as Created Timestamp Exists . Every user in Lytics will have a timestamp of when they were created. Therefore, the number of users who do not meet the condition of having a created timestamp will always be 0. Working With Rule Sets When building elaborate audiences, having a single set of rules that are evaluated using either an AND or an OR is not enough. A ruleset is a set of rules that itself can be used as a rule for an even larger set of rules that is again evaluated using an AND or an OR . This audience has two rulesets. The first ruleset has one rule: all users who have the characteristic Email Capture Status: Known Email . The second ruleset has two rules: all users have some affinity for Marketing OR Advertising content. Combining these two rulesets with the AND operator produces an audience that targets users with an email address that have some interest in either marketing or advertising. This audience could be used to email a special newsletter or promotion about a product or trending topic that is related to marketing or advertising. Excluding Rule Sets Rulesets, just like rules, can be excluded. Clicking the Include/Exclude toogle on the second ruleset will result in the audience targeting all users with an email address who do not have some interest in either marketing or advertising. It could be used to send a different email to the remainder of your users with email addresses. Building Audiences: Configuration Options Configure your Lytics audiences with the following options to execute your use cases. Enabling API Access By default, newly created Lytics audiences are not enabled for API access and thus will not be available to public APIs. Enabling API access is necessary when integrating with other client-side tags/ pixels, Pathfora , or the Lytics personalization API endpoints. Select the API Accessible checkbox to enable access. Generate Insights Lytics Insights provide visibility into the performance of your audiences and campaigns as users interact with your brand. Insights are generated out-of-the-box for Lytics Behavioral and Engagement audiences. You can also request up to 10 custom audiences to be prioritized as candidates for generating Insights. When creating a new audience or editing an existing one, select the Generate Insights checkbox to make that audience a candidate for Insights (shown in the screenshot above). Lytics prioritizes Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences for your account. Therefore, even if you select the \"Generate Insights\" option for a particular audience, it is not guaranteed to show up in your Insights drawer. Managing Audiences Managing audiences becomes important as an account develops and your user base grows. Audiences are critical to both targeted campaigns as well as discovering insights about your users. The Audiences section of Lytics houses all of your account’s audiences. You can view, create, and manage audiences from this section. Audiences are listed alphabetically by default. Click any column header to change the sort property. Common sort options are Last Modified and Size (the number of users in the audience). Naming Your Audiences For better targeting, Lytics encourages the creation of many audiences. They’re easy and free to make. When working with a large library of audiences, naming conventions become important. Name your audiences by purpose and include any categorization in the name. Giving them a common prefix (e.g., Holiday Promo: Tech lovers, Holiday Promo: Loyal Shoppers) will help you to keep everything related next to each other in the user interface. Audiences appear throughout the Lytics platform. Make sure your naming convention works in any context to avoid confusion. Finding Audiences The easiest way to find an audience is to use the Search box. As you enter your search term the audience list will display any matching audiences. 📘 Fuzzy matching is used to search for audiences so the results will not be an exact match to the search term. Editing Audiences Occasionally you will want to return to previously created audiences and update the logic used to create the segment. Find the audience you would like to edit Click on the audience to navigate to the overview of the audience Click the Edit button to enter the audience builder Make your desired changes within the audience builder Click Save 🚧 When editing audiences that are in an active triggered workflow, it is recommended that you reconfigure the job after the audience changes have been made. Duplicating Audiences Find the audience you would like to duplicate Click on the audience to navigate to the overview of the audience Click the ... button to enter the audience builder. The audience builder will be pre-populated with all of the criteria of the audience you duplicated. Make any desired changes Click Save 🚧 Audiences created by duplication will retain the name and slug of the duplicated audience, but with have \"duplicate\" appended at the end. It is recommended that you update both the name and manually input a unique slug name for clarity sake. Deleting Audiences Deleting audiences is an integral part to keeping a tidy workspace in Lytics. Audiences can be deleted in one of two ways: individually or in batch. Note: Deleting an audience does not delete the users associated with that audience. Deleting an Individual Audience From the Browse Audiences list, select the name of the audience you wish to delete. From the options menu, select Delete . Click Delete . Click Accept to confirm. Deleting Multiple Audiences From the Browse Audiences list, select the checkboxes of the audiences you wish to delete. NOTE: Audience selection persists when changing pages allowing you to select audiences from multiple pages. Click Delete Selected Audiences . Click Delete . NOTE: Lytics will check to see if the audiences you selected are safe to delete. Audiences are considered safe if they are not used in an ongoing export, campaign, or another audience's definition. You will be prompted to delete dependant audiences, click Yes to delete the selected audience and any dependants listed or Skip cancel deletion of the selected audience. Click Accept to confirm. Maintaining Audiences 📘 From the Audiences page, click any audience in the list to view all of its details. An audience's landing page contains a lot of valuable information about your users and the audience itself. At the top of the audience page, you will find the following information... Audience name ID Slug Created by Created on date Last updated date API access configuration Below this information you will find multiple tabs where you can access additional information about the audience. Audience Summary The audience summary page is designed to provide insights into the current state of an audience as well as how the audience has changed over time. When first navigating to an audience landing page, this tab will be selected by default. The Summary tab includes the following sections: General Metrics The total number of users in this audience The total percentage of this audience as compared to the total number of profiles in your account The percentage change in audience size over the last 7 and last 30 days Activity trend (graph of audience size over the defined date range) Activity Graph After creating a new audience, the audience size graph will begin to populate within a day. Depending on the date range you specify, the activity graph can be viewed using following intervals: Hourly Daily Weekly Monthly Audience Size Trends 📘 The statistics for audience size start from the creation date of the audience. Keep in mind that audiences are real-time. This makes them quite different from the user lists in other marketing tools which are frozen in time and only change when you update the list. Audiences are filters applied to the total audience and will change whenever a user's behavior changes in a way that will add or remove them from the audience definition. In this way, tracking audience size over time is a powerful reporting tool. For example, you create an audience that contains users who have visited the international news section of your website. Upon creation the audience contains 120,000 users. You then run a marketing campaign promoting your international news section. After one week, the audience has grown from 120,000 to 400,000 users with most of the growth occurring in the 24 hours after the campaign was launched. This is clear evidence that the campaign was effective, and most effective in the first 24 hours, at driving users to your international news section.s Audience Details Select the Details tab to view the following sections: Exports : This section outlines what exports (if any) are using this audience Recent Users : This section allows you to view a sample of users in this audience who have been active recently (by clicking the View button) Audience Characteristics Select the Characteristics tab to view the characteristics of users in this audience. Characteristics include: Behavior Web Activity Content Affinity Campaign Referral Interactions Audience Logs Select the Logs tab to view recent events relating to this audience. Activity such as creation, updating and syncing can all be found here. Activating Audiences Activating Audiences in Experiences Creating a Lytics Experience is one of the easiest and most common ways to activate Lytics Audiences. Learn more about Lytics Experiences to find out how you can engage your audiences on site. Accessing Audiences Using the Public Entity API The Lytics Experience Editor is a great way to get started with website personalization, but through the use of the Lytics API, there is much more that can be done. The Lytics Experience editor is powered by the Pathfora SDK which is in turn powered by the Lytics Entity API. The Lytics Entity API is how to find out what audiences the current user belongs to as well as what traits the user has. Using the Lytics Entity API it's possible to create completely custom personalized experiences on your site. 📘 Personalizing a site using the Public Entity API requires making code changes to the host website. To read more about the Entity API, check out the API documentation . Exporting Audiences to Other Tools A core benefit of Lytics is exporting your smart audiences to the other tools in your marketing tech stack. That way, the campaigns run on your channels are enriched with the behavioral data and content affinities powered by data science on Lytics. From the audience overview page, click the Export button to create a new export job . The Export menu lists built in exports such as Email CSV and any out of the box Integrations.

      "This is great if your audience is targeting engaged users who have shown interest in your upcoming product, but not so great if your audience targets users with outstanding support tickets. Lytics makes it easy to find these insights so your campaign strategies can be adjusted accordingly. Audiences can be used in Lytics Experiences, third-party ad campaigns, and tools like Google BigQuery for advanced reporting. When all of that isn’t enough, the Lytics APIs provide deep integrations with the Lytics platform. 📘 Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences . Once on the Audiences page, click on the + Create New Audience button. Creating Audiences Building new audiences allows you to target specific groups of your users. Why send the same email to your entire audience? Instead, send emails to distinct audiences with content that you know those users enjoy. Lytics gives you the ability to create audiences based on cross channel user data, behaviors and interests. Audiences can be built using existing audiences, user content affinity, your personalization campaigns, or by custom rules utilizing any user fields in your Lytics account. Create rulesets by combining multiple audiences and boolean logic to target users with as much or as little granularity as you require. Lytics updates your audiences automatically. Once an audience is built, users will join or leave whenever they match (or fail to match) the rules you have set. Export your audiences, often in real-time, to your integrated marketing tools giving you the power of Lytics however you engage with your users. 📘 Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences . Once on the Audiences page, click on the + Create New Audience button. Building Audiences: Existing Audiences The Existing Audiences tab in the audience builder contains a list of all existing audiences and their size categorized by audience type such as characteristic. Characteristics are pre-built audiences pertaining to single user attributes such as location or behavior. Keep in mind that the audience sizes you see in this list are not real-time. They are updated every few hours for performance reasons. When creating or editing an audience, however, you will always see real-time numbers so that you can make precise decisions based on accurate data. You can use the Filter by Audience Type drop-down to filter the list or use the Search box to quickly find an audience by name. Select an audience or characteristic to add it to the definition of the audience you are building or editing. Building Audiences: Content Affinity The Content Affinity tab in the audience builder is used to add Affinity-based rules to your audience. Since Affinities are a group of related Topics , this allows you to effectively target users interested in several subjects or products. In the example above, we created a \"Lavender\" Affinity for an online beauty store, which includes 6 Topics such as \"lavender\", \"lavender lotion\", and \"lavender luxury.\" Instead of creating an audience with 6 rules (one per Topic), we just select our Lavender Affinity that contains those 6 Topics. Once you choose an Affinity for your audience, you will be able to select the range of affinity values. The histogram displays the distribution of user interest for the selected Affinity and is helpful to build an audience that has the desired size. By default, users with Any Affinity are selected. You can choose a built-in range by clicking any of the Affinity buttons or, to set a custom range, use the slider to refine the range of users to target. As you change the range, the total number of users that fit the range is shown in the right column. As soon as you create an Affinity, Lytics start scoring users against it as they interact with your content or products. For active users, you can expect this number to start populating within a few days. For inactive users, it can take up to 2 weeks for them to be scored against an Affinity. So it's recommended that you create Affinities in advance of the audience needed for an Affinity-based campaign. Topic-Based Audiences Under the Custom Rule tab in the Audience Builder, you can find the existing audiences based on Topics in your content taxonomy. If you want to create new audiences based on a single Topic, you can do so as follows: Search for \"Topics\" in the Custom Rule tab of the Audience Builder Select the Topic of interest. Set the threshold according to the desired users' level of interest in that Topic. Once you hit \"Add Condition\", the custom rule for a Topic will look like this: Although Topics are still supported in the Audience Builder, we strongly recommend you use Affinities to build audiences for a more efficient workflow and more effective targeting. Inferred Content Affinity Some users may find a field named Inferred Content Affinity when trying to build affinity or topic based audiences. This field contains topics that a user could be interested in even though they may not have interacted with the topics directly. To learn more about how these inferrences are made, you can read about our content taxonomy process . Note that topic affinity already includes this information, but this field contains only inferred affinity. We would also recommend not using this field to build audiences as it is not a wholistic view of a user's affinity. Building Audiences: Custom Rules The Custom Rules tab in the audience builder is used to add any rule based on a user field to the audience being built or edited. Custom rules allow for ultimate access of all data that is aggregated in user fields. Custom rules are simple statements that can be combined to create very precise audiences. Using them correctly requires a thorough understanding of the data being used, but there is no replacement for this level of segmentation. 🚧 Audiences Field Value Limits Audiences can have a maximum of 1,000 field values. \"Values\" in this context apply to a single evaluation against a user field. When exceeded, the error message \"Audience too large! Remove values to save this audience\" will be displayed. For example, the following scenarios would trigger the alert: An audience with a single rule that supports multiple values ( e.g. contains one of) with 1001+ values. An audience with 1001+ user field rules each with a single evaluation (e.g. exists). Any variation in between such as two rules each containing over 500 evaluations, etc. The user field list displays all the fields in your account. The Source drop-down can be used to filter on the data stream the user field came from. The Includes drop-down can be used to filter user fields on the percentage of users that have a field. Use the Search input to search for a user field by name. Generally, to add a Custom Rule to an audience definition: Choose a User Field Choose an operator (e.g., text contains, value is less than) Choose a value There are variations to this general procedure based on the type of the user field and the operator chosen. User Field Types How you work with user fields in the Custom Rules tab will depend on way the field is mapped in on the user profile. Numeric User Fields Numeric user fields are most commonly used for data that is counted. For instance, the number of times a visitor has been to a website or the number of times a subscriber has opened an email. Exact values can be matched, but more commonly, inequalities are expressed. Examples: Total Number of Visits must equal 5: Any user who has visited 4 times, 6 times, or any number of times other than 5 will not be matched by this rule. Total Number of Visits must be less than 3: Any user who has visited 0, 1, or 2 times will be matched by this rule. Text User Fields Text User fields are commonly used for words and miscellaneous information. For instance, a user’s first name. Since there is no mathematical relationship between two text values, the operations used are generally exact match or partial match. There are 5 operator options when making audiences with text user fields: Equal : The value for the field you want the audience to have. Format and character spacing for the value must match exactly what is in the data stream. You can select the value by interacting with the visualization or be promoted with available values by typing into the search bar. Contain : The text entered (case sensitive and exact order) appears within a value for the field. Be Like : Use the wildcard character * along with text to decide the parts of values you want to match. E.g., test will only match on the exact string test, while test* will match strings starting with test, such as \"testing\", and *test* will match any string that has test in it, such as \"my test case\". Equal one of : Add each, exact value you want included individually. A new search bar will appear after each selection. You can remove values from the list using the “x” to the left of the value. The logic for each of these rules follows the logic from “Equal”. Exist : Excludes everyone that does not have a value for the field. Examples First Name must equal Ash: Only users named Ash will be matched. First name must contain Ash: Any user named Ash will be matched. Additionally, anyone named Ashley, Ashton, or any other name that has the letters \"Ash\" next to each other will be matched. Dash or Natasha will NOT be matched - as these do not have an “A.” To make an audience that includes these, create a second rule set for “First name must contain ash.” Date User Fields Date user fields are commonly used for any data that represents a point in time. For instance, the last time a user visited a website. Most commonly, a date is chosen to divide the people who fall before or after that date. You will need to select both your starting point and a direction in time for your custom rule. Your starting point could be a fixed point in time (useful for milestone events, like product launches) or a relative point in time (useful for scheduled follow ups). Since each rule only handles going forward or backward from a single point in time, you may need to create two rules that work together to bound a range of time. One rule will capture all dates after the first point in time, and a second rule will capture all dates before a later point in time. Some date fields have a natural boundary, such as Last Visits, which will never include a date in the future. If you want all Last Visits from a point in time up until now, you would only need to create one rule. Examples Last Visit must be Before June 22, 2016: Created by selecting Specific Date and the direction Before . This rule includes only users who have not visited since the 22nd of June. Last Visit must be After 3 days in the past: Created by selecting Relative Date , entering 3 days In the past and selecting the direction After . This rule includes only users who have visited in the last three days. Subscription End Date must be within the next 30 days: Created by building two rules: one to set the start date to always be the current date and the other to set the end date to 30 days in the future relative to the current date. Create the first rule by selecting Relative Date , After , entering 0 Days , selecting In the past , and clicking Add Condition . Create the second rule by selecting Relative Date , Before , 30 Days , In the future , and clicking Add Condition . This audience will now include all users who have a subscription ending in the next 30 days beginning with the current date. Set User Fields Set user fields are commonly used for collecting related data over time. For instance, all the URLs a user has visited. These fields are generally used much like text user fields, even though the data is structured differently. Examples All URL Paths Ever must contain one of /blog , /products , or /about : Any user who has visited any one of these three paths will be matched. Followed Sports must contain Baseball: Any user who follows Baseball will be matched. This is true whether they only follow Baseball or follow Baseball in addition to Football, Hockey, and Bowling. Map/Nested User Fields Map user fields are used to add hierarchy to a dynamic domain of data. For instance, Events By Device is a count of all events, but grouped by each device. So instead of building a rule by only specifying the count, the rule is built by first specifying the device, then the count. The device could be thought of as an additional, dynamic user field that is nested under the map user field. Selecting a Key When using a map user field, the first step is selecting the dynamic user field to build a rule with, called a key . Using the URLs Visited example, the keys could include any numeric value. Since these keys are dynamic,  counts will be updated automatically. Building the Condition Once a key is selected a condition is built. The type of the nested user field is called the value type . In the case of URLs Visited , the value type is numeric. When building audiences with nested fields, the visualization chart will not display for mapped fields to minimize page load times. Examples Events By Device (Desktop) must be greater than 5: Only users who have visited the website more than 5 times on a desktop will be matched. If a user has visited more than 5 times on the mobile web, they will not be matched. Signup Date for Event (Personalization Webinar) must be within the last 7 days: Only the users who signed up for the Personalization Webinar in the last week will be matched. Users who signed up more than 7 days ago will not be matched. Users who signed up for a different event in the last 7 days will also not be matched. Out of the Box Custom Rules Some user fields are mapped by default and populated through the use of the Lytics Javascript tag and Experiences. These out of the box fields can be incredibly useful when building audiences using Custom Rules. Lytics Javascript Tag Assuming that you have not made changes to the 'default' web LQL file that is automatically created when the Lytics Javascript Tag is installed, the following custom rules are available to you for use when building audiences. Rule Description All channels used (web, email, etc.) All the channels a user has been active in based on the data imported into your Lytics account. Bot The Lytics JavaScript Tag captures information from the web browser to determine if the user is bot or not. When data is collected from the Lytics JavaScript Tag, that request will include the user-agent of the client that was used to initiate the request. The user agent is parsed and evaluated using a third party library . That evaluation determines if the request is from a \"bot\" or not. NOTE : The third party library does not capture all bots. Created Timestamp The timestamp of when a user profile was created. When an anonymous and known profile is merged the oldest timestamp is retained. Devices Used Any devices a user has used e.g. desktop, Android, iOS. Event First Time Seen Captures the timestamp of the first event sent through from your website by either your tag manager or the Lytics JavaScript Tag, along with some details around what that event was. Event Last Time Seen Captures the timestamp of the last event sent through from your website from either your tag manager or our Lytics JavaScript Tag, along with some details around what that event was. Last Active The last timestamp on the profile that indicated activity on web or any connected sources importing activity data to your account. Last Activity by Channel The last timestamp on the profile that indicated activity on a particular channel. Last Visit City Pulled from visit_city field from your Default (web) source and indicates the last value seen. Last Visit Country Pulled from visit_country field from your Default (web) source and indicates the last value seen. Last Visit State/Province Pulled from visit_region field from your Default (web) source and indicated last value seen. Modified Timestamp The last time that a profile was updated. Random, uniform partition of users Every profile in Lytics is assigned a random number between 1-",
      "By using this rule, you can perform simple A/B tests to decrease the size of an audience for testing down to a certain percentage of the total audience size. Read more about simple AB testing. Score Frequency, Intensity, Momentum, Propensity, Quntatiy, or Recency. The values of the user's Lytics behavorial scores. See Lytics Scores for detailed descriptions of these fields. Time of First Visit The time of a user’s first visit to your website since the Lytics JavaScript Tag was installed. Time of Last Visit The time of a user’s last website visit. Timezone The timezone they are in based on their last web session. Total Number of Visits Total number of different times a user has come to your website. Total Pageview Count A user’s lifetime total of pageviews. User Agent The last browser user agent of the user e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge. Web Cookie ID(current) The cookie id of the last session a user had on your website. Web Cookie IDs(all) All of the cookie ids tied to a user. Web Domains Visited All the domains a user has visited that have the Lytics JavaScript Tag installed. Web Events by Hour Number of tracked events for each hour of the day in 24 hour UTC time . Web Events by Week Number of tracked events for each hour in a week. Experiences There are a variety of use cases that involve targeting users who have engaged with previous marketing campaigns. For example, if a user converted on an Iterable Experience email, and you want to follow up with an SMS message. The steps below will walk you through how to create an audience to target users who were reached by or clicked on an Experience . Navigate to Experiences and search for the one you would like to use. You will need to get an ID for the Experience, which differs depending on the Experience type: For Lytics Web Personalization Experiences : Look up the URL for this Experience and locate the long string of numbers of letters as highlighted below. Save this to your clipboard. For all other Experience types : open developer tools and navigate to the “Network” tab. Refresh the page and filter the requests by “experience”. Find the response that looks similar to the example below, and save the external_id value (nested under vehicle ) to your clipboard. Note: You can also use the Experience API to fetch the current Experience by ID to get the full payload, including the Experience's external_id . In your Lytics account, navigate to Audiences > Create New Audience . In the audience builder, select Custom Rule and search for the provider of the Experience you would like to segment on. After you enter a provider, you should see a field for conversions and reach on those Experience types. Select the action you wish to segment off of. Copy and paste the ID you copied from step 2 into the text box. Choose Exist as your operator and add the condition to your audience. Select Add Condition . You now have an audience based on past interactions with an Experience. You can save the audience as is, or continue to add rules based on your use case. Building Audiences: Multiple Rules and Rule Sets All audience definitions are comprised of rules based on existing audiences , content affinity , campaigns , and custom rules . You may have noticed that after you add your first rule in the audience builder you have the option to Add New Rule or Add New Rule Set . Adding new rules and rulesets, and setting the conditions for their interaction, gives you the ability to refine which users your audiences target. Working With Multiple Rules This audience has a single rule: included all users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers . This will select all users with an intensity score of 20 or less but with a frequency score of 20 or greater. These are users who interact often but not on a deep level. You can refine this rule further by clicking Add New Rule . This audience now also includes a rule for users who have a low content affinity for Technology content. Now that it has been added, there are three numbers of interest. The first number, 87,650, is the number of users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers . The second number, 466,730, is the number of users who have low affinity for Technology content. The third number, 11,514, are the users who meet both of these conditions. Clicking the And/Or toggle, will switch the way the two rules intereact. The audience now includes all 542,921 users who either have the characteristic Behavior: Perusers or have low afffinity for Technology content. Excluding Rules In addition to the And/Or toggle, there is the Included/Excluded toggle. This toggle inverts a condition. This audience contains a rule that targets the 159,084 users with the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile or users who have used a mobile devices. Clicking the Include/Exclude toggle the audience will now target the 705,166 users who do not have the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile . The sum of the two numbers will be the total audience size that meets those rule(s). This is especially apparent when using a rule such as Created Timestamp Exists . Every user in Lytics will have a timestamp of when they were created. Therefore, the number of users who do not meet the condition of having a created timestamp will always be",
      "Working With Rule Sets When building elaborate audiences, having a single set of rules that are evaluated using either an AND or an OR is not enough. A ruleset is a set of rules that itself can be used as a rule for an even larger set of rules that is again evaluated using an AND or an OR . This audience has two rulesets. The first ruleset has one rule: all users who have the characteristic Email Capture Status: Known Email . The second ruleset has two rules: all users have some affinity for Marketing OR Advertising content. Combining these two rulesets with the AND operator produces an audience that targets users with an email address that have some interest in either marketing or advertising. This audience could be used to email a special newsletter or promotion about a product or trending topic that is related to marketing or advertising. Excluding Rule Sets Rulesets, just like rules, can be excluded. Clicking the Include/Exclude toogle on the second ruleset will result in the audience targeting all users with an email address who do not have some interest in either marketing or advertising. It could be used to send a different email to the remainder of your users with email addresses. Building Audiences: Configuration Options Configure your Lytics audiences with the following options to execute your use cases. Enabling API Access By default, newly created Lytics audiences are not enabled for API access and thus will not be available to public APIs. Enabling API access is necessary when integrating with other client-side tags/ pixels, Pathfora , or the Lytics personalization API endpoints. Select the API Accessible checkbox to enable access. Generate Insights Lytics Insights provide visibility into the performance of your audiences and campaigns as users interact with your brand. Insights are generated out-of-the-box for Lytics Behavioral and Engagement audiences. You can also request up to 10 custom audiences to be prioritized as candidates for generating Insights. When creating a new audience or editing an existing one, select the Generate Insights checkbox to make that audience a candidate for Insights (shown in the screenshot above). Lytics prioritizes Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences for your account. Therefore, even if you select the \"Generate Insights\" option for a particular audience, it is not guaranteed to show up in your Insights drawer. Managing Audiences Managing audiences becomes important as an account develops and your user base grows. Audiences are critical to both targeted campaigns as well as discovering insights about your users. The Audiences section of Lytics houses all of your account’s audiences. You can view, create, and manage audiences from this section. Audiences are listed alphabetically by default. Click any column header to change the sort property. Common sort options are Last Modified and Size (the number of users in the audience). Naming Your Audiences For better targeting, Lytics encourages the creation of many audiences. They’re easy and free to make. When working with a large library of audiences, naming conventions become important. Name your audiences by purpose and include any categorization in the name. Giving them a common prefix (e.g., Holiday Promo: Tech lovers, Holiday Promo: Loyal Shoppers) will help you to keep everything related next to each other in the user interface. Audiences appear throughout the Lytics platform. Make sure your naming convention works in any context to avoid confusion. Finding Audiences The easiest way to find an audience is to use the Search box. As you enter your search term the audience list will display any matching audiences. 📘 Fuzzy matching is used to search for audiences so the results will not be an exact match to the search term. Editing Audiences Occasionally you will want to return to previously created audiences and update the logic used to create the segment. Find the audience you would like to edit Click on the audience to navigate to the overview of the audience Click the Edit button to enter the audience builder Make your desired changes within the audience builder Click Save 🚧 When editing audiences that are in an active triggered workflow, it is recommended that you reconfigure the job after the audience changes have been made. Duplicating Audiences Find the audience you would like to duplicate Click on the audience to navigate to the overview of the audience Click the ... button to enter the audience builder. The audience builder will be pre-populated with all of the criteria of the audience you duplicated. Make any desired changes Click Save 🚧 Audiences created by duplication will retain the name and slug of the duplicated audience, but with have \"duplicate\" appended at the end. It is recommended that you update both the name and manually input a unique slug name for clarity sake. Deleting Audiences Deleting audiences is an integral part to keeping a tidy workspace in Lytics. Audiences can be deleted in one of two ways: individually or in batch. Note: Deleting an audience does not delete the users associated with that audience. Deleting an Individual Audience From the Browse Audiences list, select the name of the audience you wish to delete. From the options menu, select Delete . Click Delete . Click Accept to confirm. Deleting Multiple Audiences From the Browse Audiences list, select the checkboxes of the audiences you wish to delete. NOTE: Audience selection persists when changing pages allowing you to select audiences from multiple pages. Click Delete Selected Audiences . Click Delete . NOTE: Lytics will check to see if the audiences you selected are safe to delete. Audiences are considered safe if they are not used in an ongoing export, campaign, or another audience's definition. You will be prompted to delete dependant audiences, click Yes to delete the selected audience and any dependants listed or Skip cancel deletion of the selected audience. Click Accept to confirm. Maintaining Audiences 📘 From the Audiences page, click any audience in the list to view all of its details. An audience's landing page contains a lot of valuable information about your users and the audience itself. At the top of the audience page, you will find the following information... Audience name ID Slug Created by Created on date Last updated date API access configuration Below this information you will find multiple tabs where you can access additional information about the audience. Audience Summary The audience summary page is designed to provide insights into the current state of an audience as well as how the audience has changed over time. When first navigating to an audience landing page, this tab will be selected by default. The Summary tab includes the following sections: General Metrics The total number of users in this audience The total percentage of this audience as compared to the total number of profiles in your account The percentage change in audience size over the last 7 and last 30 days Activity trend (graph of audience size over the defined date range) Activity Graph After creating a new audience, the audience size graph will begin to populate within a day. Depending on the date range you specify, the activity graph can be viewed using following intervals: Hourly Daily Weekly Monthly Audience Size Trends 📘 The statistics for audience size start from the creation date of the audience. Keep in mind that audiences are real-time. This makes them quite different from the user lists in other marketing tools which are frozen in time and only change when you update the list. Audiences are filters applied to the total audience and will change whenever a user's behavior changes in a way that will add or remove them from the audience definition. In this way, tracking audience size over time is a powerful reporting tool. For example, you create an audience that contains users who have visited the international news section of your website. Upon creation the audience contains 120,000 users. You then run a marketing campaign promoting your international news section. After one week, the audience has grown from 120,000 to 400,000 users with most of the growth occurring in the 24 hours after the campaign was launched. This is clear evidence that the campaign was effective, and most effective in the first 24 hours, at driving users to your international news section.s Audience Details Select the Details tab to view the following sections: Exports : This section outlines what exports (if any) are using this audience Recent Users : This section allows you to view a sample of users in this audience who have been active recently (by clicking the View button) Audience Characteristics Select the Characteristics tab to view the characteristics of users in this audience. Characteristics include: Behavior Web Activity Content Affinity Campaign Referral Interactions Audience Logs Select the Logs tab to view recent events relating to this audience. Activity such as creation, updating and syncing can all be found here. Activating Audiences Activating Audiences in Experiences Creating a Lytics Experience is one of the easiest and most common ways to activate Lytics Audiences. Learn more about Lytics Experiences to find out how you can engage your audiences on site. Accessing Audiences Using the Public Entity API The Lytics Experience Editor is a great way to get started with website personalization, but through the use of the Lytics API, there is much more that can be done. The Lytics Experience editor is powered by the Pathfora SDK which is in turn powered by the Lytics Entity API. The Lytics Entity API is how to find out what audiences the current user belongs to as well as what traits the user has. Using the Lytics Entity API it's possible to create completely custom personalized experiences on your site. 📘 Personalizing a site using the Public Entity API requires making code changes to the host website. To read more about the Entity API, check out the API documentation . Exporting Audiences to Other Tools A core benefit of Lytics is exporting your smart audiences to the other tools in your marketing tech stack. That way, the campaigns run on your channels are enriched with the behavioral data and content affinities powered by data science on Lytics. From the audience overview page, click the Export button to create a new export job . The Export menu lists built in exports such as Email CSV and any out of the box Integrations. Specific instructions for exporting can be found in the Integrations section (under the desired tool) of our documentation. Updated 4 months ago",

      "will match strings starting with test, such as \"testing\", and",
      "will match any string that has test in it, such as \"my test case\". Equal one of : Add each, exact value you want included individually. A new search bar will appear after each selection. You can remove values from the list using the “x” to the left of the value. The logic for each of these rules follows the logic from “Equal”. Exist : Excludes everyone that does not have a value for the field. Examples First Name must equal Ash: Only users named Ash will be matched. First name must contain Ash: Any user named Ash will be matched. Additionally, anyone named Ashley, Ashton, or any other name that has the letters \"Ash\" next to each other will be matched. Dash or Natasha will NOT be matched",
      "as these do not have an “A.” To make an audience that includes these, create a second rule set for “First name must contain ash.” Date User Fields Date user fields are commonly used for any data that represents a point in time. For instance, the last time a user visited a website. Most commonly, a date is chosen to divide the people who fall before or after that date. You will need to select both your starting point and a direction in time for your custom rule. Your starting point could be a fixed point in time (useful for milestone events, like product launches) or a relative point in time (useful for scheduled follow ups). Since each rule only handles going forward or backward from a single point in time, you may need to create two rules that work together to bound a range of time. One rule will capture all dates after the first point in time, and a second rule will capture all dates before a later point in time. Some date fields have a natural boundary, such as Last Visits, which will never include a date in the future. If you want all Last Visits from a point in time up until now, you would only need to create one rule. Examples Last Visit must be Before June 22, 2016: Created by selecting Specific Date and the direction Before . This rule includes only users who have not visited since the 22nd of June. Last Visit must be After 3 days in the past: Created by selecting Relative Date , entering 3 days In the past and selecting the direction After . This rule includes only users who have visited in the last three days. Subscription End Date must be within the next 30 days: Created by building two rules: one to set the start date to always be the current date and the other to set the end date to 30 days in the future relative to the current date. Create the first rule by selecting Relative Date , After , entering 0 Days , selecting In the past , and clicking Add Condition . Create the second rule by selecting Relative Date , Before , 30 Days , In the future , and clicking Add Condition . This audience will now include all users who have a subscription ending in the next 30 days beginning with the current date. Set User Fields Set user fields are commonly used for collecting related data over time. For instance, all the URLs a user has visited. These fields are generally used much like text user fields, even though the data is structured differently. Examples All URL Paths Ever must contain one of /blog , /products , or /about : Any user who has visited any one of these three paths will be matched. Followed Sports must contain Baseball: Any user who follows Baseball will be matched. This is true whether they only follow Baseball or follow Baseball in addition to Football, Hockey, and Bowling. Map/Nested User Fields Map user fields are used to add hierarchy to a dynamic domain of data. For instance, Events By Device is a count of all events, but grouped by each device. So instead of building a rule by only specifying the count, the rule is built by first specifying the device, then the count. The device could be thought of as an additional, dynamic user field that is nested under the map user field. Selecting a Key When using a map user field, the first step is selecting the dynamic user field to build a rule with, called a key . Using the URLs Visited example, the keys could include any numeric value. Since these keys are dynamic,  counts will be updated automatically. Building the Condition Once a key is selected a condition is built. The type of the nested user field is called the value type . In the case of URLs Visited , the value type is numeric. When building audiences with nested fields, the visualization chart will not display for mapped fields to minimize page load times. Examples Events By Device (Desktop) must be greater than 5: Only users who have visited the website more than 5 times on a desktop will be matched. If a user has visited more than 5 times on the mobile web, they will not be matched. Signup Date for Event (Personalization Webinar) must be within the last 7 days: Only the users who signed up for the Personalization Webinar in the last week will be matched. Users who signed up more than 7 days ago will not be matched. Users who signed up for a different event in the last 7 days will also not be matched. Out of the Box Custom Rules Some user fields are mapped by default and populated through the use of the Lytics Javascript tag and Experiences. These out of the box fields can be incredibly useful when building audiences using Custom Rules. Lytics Javascript Tag Assuming that you have not made changes to the 'default' web LQL file that is automatically created when the Lytics Javascript Tag is installed, the following custom rules are available to you for use when building audiences. Rule Description All channels used (web, email, etc.) All the channels a user has been active in based on the data imported into your Lytics account. Bot The Lytics JavaScript Tag captures information from the web browser to determine if the user is bot or not. When data is collected from the Lytics JavaScript Tag, that request will include the user"

    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Topic Taxonomy Using data science techniques to look at the topic overlap between classified content, Lytics will programmatically build a topic taxonomy. In addition to programmatically building this taxonomy, Lytics dynamically adjusts the taxonomy as new content gets published. The topic taxonomy is stored as a weighted and directional graph. Although this structure may be daunting to look at—and even more daunting to try and utilize by hand—Lytics uses it when determining content recommendations. Topic Relationships Topics are determined to be related by evaluating how they occur together and how they occur independently. When two topics occur together frequently (meaning in multiple documents), it is safe to assume they are related. In addition to the relationship existing, Lytics will determine the direction of the relationship. Is \"Cookies\" a subtopic of \"Baking\" or is \"Baking\" a subtopic of \"Cookies\"? The co-occurrence of topics determines the relationship. The independent occurrence of a topic determines the direction. Since the topic \"Cookies\" frequently occurs with \"Baking,\" but \"Baking\" frequently occurs without \"Cookies,\" \"Cookies\" must be a subtopic of \"Cookies.\" To draw this example further, \"Baking\" may be a subtopic of \"Recipes,\" \"Recipes\" may be a subtopic of \"Cooking,\" and \"Cooking\" may be a subtopic of \"Hobbies.\" This is important because it allows Lytics to make affinity inferences. A user with a high affinity for \"Cookies\" may be interested in general \"Baking\" content. Weighting Relationships The weight between relationships is incredibly important to consider when making affinity inferences. For instance, Michael Jordan played baseball professionally for one dark year in the 90s. This means there are valid relationships between Michael Jordan and Baseball and Michael Jordan and Basketball. Most people who know anything about sports or pop culture know Michael Jordan as a basketball icon. The way this gets reflected in taxonomy is through relationship weights. The weight between Michael Jordan and Basketball is strong, while the weight between Michael Jordan and Baseball is weak. By having weights, affinity inferences can use those weights as thresholds for building further relationships or recommending content. A user who has shown interest in Michael Jordan is more likely to be interested in Basketball than they are to be interested in Baseball. Unless they are interested in Sports Icons From The 90s, they might be more interested in Ken Griffey Jr. A rich topic taxonomy will surface this nuanced information. The Graph Representation of the Taxonomy A graph is the ideal data structure for topic taxonomies and taxonomies in general. Since each topic can have many subtopics and be the subtopic of many things, the correct way to structure this data is with a graph. Leaders in data modeling use this approach. Notable examples are Facebook's Social Graph and Google's Knowledge Graph . Updated over 1 year ago",

    "title": "Topics & Affinities",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Topics Topics are the building blocks of the Affinity Engine . Simply put, a Topic is an attribute tied to the documents your users interact with. By default, these documents are the URLs on your site, but they can also be customized to include items from a product catalog. Each document is associated with a set of Topics that reflect the content it contains. Every user profile automatically includes the URLs they’ve visited. Thanks to the connection between URLs and their associated Topics, Lytics can algorithmically determine which Topics a user is interested in based on their behavior. This process forms the foundation of Lytics’ content recommendations and helps you build audiences around content affinity. 📘 Since topic affinities are a product of user behavior, conclusions can only be drawn about topic affinities relative to other topics and other users. For these reasons, attempting to calculate topic aversion would be an unsafe extrapolation. To view your Topics, navigate to the Interest Engine page, click on the Standard tile, and select the Topics tab. Affinities An Affinity combines one or more Topics into a targetable group. While Topics provide detailed insights, they can often be too specific for broader marketing strategies. That’s where Affinities come in—they allow you to group related Topics into a more actionable unit. For example, imagine you’re a car dealership looking to target customers interested in luxury cars. You could create a Luxury Car Affinity that includes brands like BMW, Audi, and Mercedes. This Affinity lets you build an audience of users with an interest in any luxury car brand, which you can then export to ad networks or other marketing platforms for targeted campaigns. To view your Affinities, navigate to the Interest Engine page,  click on the Standard tile, and select the Affinities tab. Resources Topics : Explore how to use Topics within the Lytics UI.

    "title": "IDP-initiated SSO (legacy)",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "IDP-initiated SSO (Legacy) 🚧 This document describes a legacy implementation that Lytics is actively deprecating. If you're looking for details on the current SSO implementation, check out the new documentation. Lytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by using Auth0 as a service provider using SAML protocol . Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the IdP initiates SSO. That is, when your end user logs in to their IdP, they will use a global portal for your organization. Users can then click a link or button that will log them into Lytics seamlessly. Behind the scenes, the IdP will be contacting the Lytics Auth0 service provider to verify the user and redirect them to a logged-in instance of the Lytics app. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML. Service Provider Configuration To configure SAML for the Lytics service provider some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information this may be appropriate, just make sure that the following information is provided to Lytics Support : Sign In URL X509 Signing Certificate (The identity provider public key - if possible encoded in a separate PEM or CER formatted file) Sign Out URL Further configuration details such as mappings may need to be provided. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in Auth0. IdP Configuration After Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider, Lytics Support will provide a metadata XML file with the following information in order to complete the IdP configuration. The key fields in this metadata are: Connection Name Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL (aka post-back or callback URL) Entity ID of the Service Provider With this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration. Testing SSO Once all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI. During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO logins and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app. If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other logins for an account. Troubleshooting SSO If it's known that SSO is going to be added to an account, then the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, then the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address. For instance, if the email listed in the IdP is abc@123 , and within Lytics it’s def@456 , then the user will have successfully been verified by their IdP, but the login within Lytics would fail as the authenticated user email would not match the user within Lytics. You would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email address abc@123 for the SSO login to be successful. It should also be noted that primary accounts are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account that the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log-in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions: Add that user to your IdP. Other methods of logging in would need to be added (Google OAuth, username/password). Remove user from all accounts and then add them back with the first account being the account that you want to be their primary account. Lytics Support can assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you may encounter. If you are receiving the error message shown below after being redirected to the app, that means there is an issue on the application side. The Lytics Support team can help debug this if you provide information on the login attempt such as the time of the login and the user and account. If you’re encountering an error earlier in the login process, such as before you are redirected to the Lytics app, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or Service provider side. Lytics’ support team can review these issues and coordinate a fix, just contact us with the details of the issue. Updated over 1 year ago",

      "IdP Configuration After Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider, Lytics Support will provide a metadata XML file with the following information in order to complete the IdP configuration. The key fields in this metadata are: Connection Name Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL (aka post-back or callback URL) Entity ID of the Service Provider With this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration. Testing SSO Once all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI. During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO logins and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app. If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other logins for an account. Troubleshooting SSO If it's known that SSO is going to be added to an account, then the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, then the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address. For instance, if the email listed in the IdP is abc@123 , and within Lytics it’s def@456 , then the user will have successfully been verified by their IdP, but the login within Lytics would fail as the authenticated user email would not match the user within Lytics. You would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email address abc@123 for the SSO login to be successful. It should also be noted that primary accounts are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account that the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log-in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions: Add that user to your IdP. Other methods of logging in would need to be added (Google OAuth, username/password). Remove user from all accounts and then add them back with the first account being the account that you want to be their primary account. Lytics Support can assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you may encounter. If you are receiving the error message shown below after being redirected to the app, that means there is an issue on the application side. The Lytics Support team can help debug this if you provide information on the login attempt such as the time of the login and the user and account. If you’re encountering an error earlier in the login process, such as before you are redirected to the Lytics app, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or Service provider side. Lytics’ support team can review these issues and coordinate a fix, just contact us with the details of the issue. Updated over 1 year ago",

    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "Leveraging Affinities The Affinity Engine enriches user profiles based on behavior, but its true value lies in how you act on that data. In Lytics, Affinity Engine insights can be applied in three key ways: segmentation, recommendation, and Lookalike Models. Segmentation Lytics integrates Affinity Engine scores directly into user profiles, allowing you to use these scores in the audience builder to segment users based on their Affinities. This unlocks a variety of strategic use cases. For example, if you're a shoe retailer launching a new line of boots, you can create an audience of users with an interest in boots, ensuring that your ad spend targets the right users instead of those with little to no interest. Beyond targeting, Affinities can help you track trends over time. You may notice that interest in boots spikes during the winter—or perhaps it begins to rise in the fall, as customers start exploring options before the colder months. Affinities provide valuable insights as user interests shift over time, making them a powerful tool for trend analysis. Recommendation and Personalization Lytics' Recommendation system blends AI with marketing strategy to help you easily suggest relevant content and products to your users. By setting up personalized Recommendations, you can deliver more engaging user experiences, which in turn boosts time on-site and overall engagement. Lytics makes it easy to get up and running with Content Recommendations. Upon configuration, our Recommendation system: Leverages over 500 behavioral signals to deliver highly relevant recommendations. Operates autonomously, with models that retrain and optimize on a weekly basis to keep recommendations fresh. Works effectively right out-of-the-box for new users, requiring little to no prior data to provide valuable content suggestions. Scales rapidly to meet the demands of large volumes and high user traffic. To get started, navigate to the Personalize page under Using Profiles , or consult the Content Recommendation API documentation Lookalike Models Affinity Engine scores are also highly valuable when building Lookalike Models. These scores offer a standardized way to compare users, creating data consistency across profiles, which is crucial for machine learning models. This consistency allows affinity scores to often emerge as key factors in Lookalike Models. If your team is working on predictive audiences, leveraging Affinities can significantly enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of your models. Updated 3 months ago",

    "title": "Single Sign-On",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "🚧 Lytics supports Single Sign-On (SSO) by using Google Cloud Identity Platform as a service provider using SAML protocol. Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the Service Provider (SP) initiates SSO. IDP-initiated SSO has been deprecated and is no longer supported by Lytics . Overview Single Sign-On (SSO) allows employees to safely and securely access a host of Internet tools with a single username and password. There are four primary reasons why your business should consider leveraging Single Sign-On: SSO helps the end user. Implementing SSO means employees are required to commit just one password to memory. With one password to remember, a user can easily create and remember a unique and secure password without writing it down. SSO reduces password fatigue and frustration and makes the employee more efficient. SSO benefits the company. Fewer passwords to remember equals fewer calls to the helpdesk, resulting in more time spent on other tasks for both the end user and IT. Fewer calls to the helpdesk (which is oftentimes outsourced) means a reduction in cost to the company as well. SSO improves security. When employees are required to remember numerous passwords, it is easy to fall into lazy habits, such as using simple, easy-to-remember passwords, which are more susceptible to hacking. Or writing passwords down on Post-it notes where they can easily be stolen or fall into the wrong hands. SSO helps with compliance. SSO helps companies increase control over the user's access to certain information as well as easily enforce password change policies. This makes it simpler for organizations to comply with HIPAA, SOX, and other regulatory groups. SP-Initiated SSO Lytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by using Google Cloud Identity Platform as a service provider using SAML protocol . Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the Service Provider (SP) initiates SSO. Once implemented, users will log in to Lytics via a special SSO form that only requires an email address. Lytics will recognize the email address and open a pop-up to the user's IdP to complete the login. Once the IdP verifies credentials, the pop-up will close, redirecting the user to a logged-in instance of their Lytics dashboard. Behind the scenes, a customer's IdP will communicate with the Lytics APIs, which use Google Cloud Identity Platform to validate the login. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML. Service Provider Configuration To configure SAML for the Lytics service provider, some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information, this may be appropriate, but please ensure that the following information is provided to Lytics Support : Entity ID Sign In URL X509 Signing Certificate Further configuration details, such as mappings, may need to be provided, but the Lytics implementation only requires the email address field to be mapped. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in the Google Cloud Identity Platform. IdP Configuration After Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider, Lytics Support will provide the following key fields of information to the customer to complete the configuration in their IdP. Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL (aka postback or callback URL) Entity ID of the Service Provider Sign-in URL With this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration. 📘 At this time, Lytics does not support providing this information in an XML metadata file. Additional information about the Service Provider may be provided on request. Testing SSO Once all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI. During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO login and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app. If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other login types for an account. Troubleshooting SSO If it's known that SSO will be added to an account, the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address. For instance, if the email listed in the IdP is abc@123 and within Lytics, it is def@456 , then there will be potentially multiple error points for a user trying to log in via the SSO form on Lytics. If the user enters abc@123 into the IdP pop-up, it will immediately fail as we use the Lytics account user to determine which IdP to redirect to. You would see an error message like the following: However, should the user enter def@456 (their Lytics account email), they will be redirected to their IdP, but the verification of the login will fail once information is sent back to Lytics. To remedy this situation, you would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email address abc@123 for the SSO login to be successful.  You can check, add, and remove users for an account using the Managing Users guide as a reference. Lytics Support can assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time, Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you encounter. With this, the team can help debug if you provide information on the login attempt, such as the login time, user, and account. If you’re encountering a verification error, but you've checked that your emails from the IdP and Lytics match, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or SP side. Contact Lytics Support with details of the issue, and our team can coordinate a fix. Account Structure with SSO It should also be noted that primary accounts (master accounts) are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions: Add that user to your IdP. Add other logging methods (Google OAuth, username/password). Remove that user from all accounts and then add them back, with the first account being the one you want to be their primary account. Assigning Roles using SSO Configuring Role Assertions for SSO in Lytics The Lytics team can configure Single Sign-On (SSO) to assign roles via SSO. This configuration must be applied to the primary (master) accounts and any additional accounts to which users need access. For more information, refer to the account structure with SSO . Important Note: Users cannot be assigned to additional accounts via SSO alone; they must be manually invited to each Lytics account to which they need access. To set up role assignments via SSO, customers must configure their Identity Provider (IDP) to include a group assertion for each account the user can access. The role of each user must be specified in the format: lytics_<AID>_<Role> Example of a SAML assertion for a user whose default account is 123 and also has access to account 234: XML <samlp:Response xmlns:ds=\"<http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">  \n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"  \n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\" xmlns:xs=\"<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\">  \n    xmlns:xsi=\"<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">  \n    Destination=\"<https://api.lytics.io/api/user/verifyauth\">  \n    Version=\"2.0\">  \n    <saml:Assertion xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"  \n        ID=\"id1\" IssueInstant=\"2024-08-29T16:02:42Z\"  \n        Issuer=\"<https://your-idp.example.com\">  \n        Version=\"2.0\">  \n        <ds:Signature xmlns:ds=\"<http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">123456>\\</ds:Signature>  \n        <saml:AttributeStatement>  \n            <saml:Attribute Name=\"Email\">  \n                <saml:AttributeValue xsi:type=\"xs:string\"> [email protected] </saml:AttributeValue>  \n            </saml:Attribute>  \n            <saml:Attribute Name=\"groups\">    \n                <saml:AttributeValue  \n                    xmlns:xsi=\"<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">  \n                    xsi:type=\"xs:string\">lytics_123_content_manager</saml:AttributeValue>  \n                <saml:AttributeValue  \n                    xmlns:xsi=\"<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">  \n                    xsi:type=\"xs:string\">lytics_123_admin</saml:AttributeValue>  \n                <saml:AttributeValue  \n                    xmlns:xsi=\"<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">  \n                    xsi:type=\"xs:string\">lytics_234_admin</saml:AttributeValue>  \n            </saml:Attribute>  \n        </saml:AttributeStatement>  \n    </saml:Assertion>  \n</samlp:Response> Note: This example is simplified to focus only on the group's assertion; a real-world example would be more detailed.

    "title": "Single Sign-On",
    "platform": "lytics",
    "content": "🚧 Lytics supports Single Sign-On (SSO) by using Google Cloud Identity Platform as a service provider using SAML protocol. Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the Service Provider (SP) initiates SSO. IDP-initiated SSO has been deprecated and is no longer supported by Lytics . Overview Single Sign-On (SSO) allows employees to safely and securely access a host of Internet tools with a single username and password. There are four primary reasons why your business should consider leveraging Single Sign-On: SSO helps the end user. Implementing SSO means employees are required to commit just one password to memory. With one password to remember, a user can easily create and remember a unique and secure password without writing it down. SSO reduces password fatigue and frustration and makes the employee more efficient. SSO benefits the company. Fewer passwords to remember equals fewer calls to the helpdesk, resulting in more time spent on other tasks for both the end user and IT. Fewer calls to the helpdesk (which is oftentimes outsourced) means a reduction in cost to the company as well. SSO improves security. When employees are required to remember numerous passwords, it is easy to fall into lazy habits, such as using simple, easy-to-remember passwords, which are more susceptible to hacking. Or writing passwords down on Post-it notes where they can easily be stolen or fall into the wrong hands. SSO helps with compliance. SSO helps companies increase control over the user's access to certain information as well as easily enforce password change policies. This makes it simpler for organizations to comply with HIPAA, SOX, and other regulatory groups. SP-Initiated SSO Lytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by using Google Cloud Identity Platform as a service provider using SAML protocol . Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the Service Provider (SP) initiates SSO. Once implemented, users will log in to Lytics via a special SSO form that only requires an email address. Lytics will recognize the email address and open a pop-up to the user's IdP to complete the login. Once the IdP verifies credentials, the pop-up will close, redirecting the user to a logged-in instance of their Lytics dashboard. Behind the scenes, a customer's IdP will communicate with the Lytics APIs, which use Google Cloud Identity Platform to validate the login. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML. Service Provider Configuration To configure SAML for the Lytics service provider, some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information, this may be appropriate, but please ensure that the following information is provided to Lytics Support : Entity ID Sign In URL X509 Signing Certificate Further configuration details, such as mappings, may need to be provided, but the Lytics implementation only requires the email address field to be mapped. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in the Google Cloud Identity Platform. IdP Configuration After Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider, Lytics Support will provide the following key fields of information to the customer to complete the configuration in their IdP. Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL (aka postback or callback URL) Entity ID of the Service Provider Sign-in URL With this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration. 📘 At this time, Lytics does not support providing this information in an XML metadata file. Additional information about the Service Provider may be provided on request. Testing SSO Once all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI. During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO login and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app. If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other login types for an account. Troubleshooting SSO If it's known that SSO will be added to an account, the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address. For instance, if the email listed in the IdP is abc@123 and within Lytics, it is def@456 , then there will be potentially multiple error points for a user trying to log in via the SSO form on Lytics. If the user enters abc@123 into the IdP pop-up, it will immediately fail as we use the Lytics account user to determine which IdP to redirect to. You would see an error message like the following: However, should the user enter def@456 (their Lytics account email), they will be redirected to their IdP, but the verification of the login will fail once information is sent back to Lytics. To remedy this situation, you would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email address abc@123 for the SSO login to be successful.  You can check, add, and remove users for an account using the Managing Users guide as a reference. Lytics Support can assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time, Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you encounter. With this, the team can help debug if you provide information on the login attempt, such as the login time, user, and account. If you’re encountering a verification error, but you've checked that your emails from the IdP and Lytics match, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or SP side. Contact Lytics Support with details of the issue, and our team can coordinate a fix. Account Structure with SSO It should also be noted that primary accounts (master accounts) are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions: Add that user to your IdP. Add other logging methods (Google OAuth, username/password). Remove that user from all accounts and then add them back, with the first account being the one you want to be their primary account. Assigning Roles using SSO Configuring Role Assertions for SSO in Lytics The Lytics team can configure Single Sign-On (SSO) to assign roles via SSO. This configuration must be applied to the primary (master) accounts and any additional accounts to which users need access. For more information, refer to the account structure with SSO . Important Note: Users cannot be assigned to additional accounts via SSO alone; they must be manually invited to each Lytics account to which they need access. To set up role assignments via SSO, customers must configure their Identity Provider (IDP) to include a group assertion for each account the user can access. The role of each user must be specified in the format: lytics_<AID>_<Role> Example of a SAML assertion for a user whose default account is 123 and also has access to account 234: XML <samlp:Response xmlns:ds=\"<http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">  \n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"  \n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\" xmlns:xs=\"<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\">  \n    xmlns:xsi=\"<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">  \n    Destination=\"<https://api.lytics.io/api/user/verifyauth\">  \n    Version=\"2.0\">  \n    <saml:Assertion xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"  \n        ID=\"id1\" IssueInstant=\"2024-08-29T16:02:42Z\"  \n        Issuer=\"<https://your-idp.example.com\">  \n        Version=\"2.0\">  \n        <ds:Signature xmlns:ds=\"<http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">123456>\\</ds:Signature>  \n        <saml:AttributeStatement>  \n            <saml:Attribute Name=\"Email\">  \n                <saml:AttributeValue xsi:type=\"xs:string\"> [email protected] </saml:AttributeValue>  \n            </saml:Attribute>  \n            <saml:Attribute Name=\"groups\">    \n                <saml:AttributeValue  \n                    xmlns:xsi=\"<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">  \n                    xsi:type=\"xs:string\">lytics_123_content_manager</saml:AttributeValue>  \n                <saml:AttributeValue  \n                    xmlns:xsi=\"<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">  \n                    xsi:type=\"xs:string\">lytics_123_admin</saml:AttributeValue>  \n                <saml:AttributeValue  \n                    xmlns:xsi=\"<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">  \n                    xsi:type=\"xs:string\">lytics_234_admin</saml:AttributeValue>  \n            </saml:Attribute>  \n        </saml:AttributeStatement>  \n    </saml:Assertion>  \n</samlp:Response> Note: This example is simplified to focus only on the group's assertion; a real-world example would be more detailed.

Implementing SSO with Okta This document will walk you through how to implement Single Sign-On to the Lytics application with Okta as an identity provider. Lytics has applied to become an official Okta partner application. Still, while the partnership is being established, you can follow these instructions to set up the custom application in Okta, which covers the IDP configuration portion of the implementation. From your Okta Administration panel, navigate to Applications and then Add Application and Create New App . Under Platform, select Web , and for Sign on Method, choose SAML 2.0 . Under General Settings , you can enter the following values: App name : Lytics App Logo : You can save and upload the following image of the Lytics Logo: Under SAML Settings , enter the following values: Single Sign-on URL : https://api.lytics.io/api/user/sso Make sure Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL is not selected). Also select Allow this app to request other SSO URLs to enable more URLs to be added. Requestable SSO URLs : Add the following two URLs: https://api.lytics.io/api/user/verifyauth (index 0) https://api.lytics.io/api/user/sso (index 1) Recipient URL : https://api.lytics.io/api/user/verifyauth Destination URL : https://api.lytics.io/api/user/verifyauth Audience URI (SP Entity ID) : app.lytics.com Name ID format : EmailAddress 📘 NOTE: The https://api.lytics.io/api/user/sso URL should only be used for Okta. Other SSO providers use the default URL https://api.lytics.io/api/user/verifyauth Click through the next step, and select Finish . You can add users to view this application in their portal using the Assignments tab. Navigate to the Sign On tab. And under settings, click on View Setup Instructions . You will need to gather the information on this page and send it to Lytics for configuration of the Service Provider: Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL Identity Provider Issuer X.509 Certificate Once Lytics has completed the service provider implementation, you may begin to test the SSO implementation through your Okta portal. Implementing SSO with OneLogin This document will walk you through how to implement Single Sign-On to the Lytics application with OneLogin as an identity provider. You can follow these instructions to set up the custom application in OneLogin, which covers the IDP configuration portion of the implementation. From the Administration menu, select Applications and then click Add App . Search for SAML Test Connector (Advanced) and select that app type. Under Configuration > Portal enter the following: Display Name : Lytics Make sure Visible in Portal is selected. For the rectangular icon, you can save and upload the following image: For the square icon, you can save and upload the following image: Click Save to continue to the configuration process. Then click on the Configuration tab to set up the SAML details. Enter the following into the Application details : Audience (EntityID) : app.lytics.com Recipient : https://api.lytics.io/api/user/verifyauth ACS (Consumer) URL Validator : ^https:\\/\\/api.lytics.io\\/api\\/user\\/verifyauth ACS (Consumer) URL : https://api.lytics.io/api/user/verifyauth Login URL : https://app.lytics.com/login/sso SAML initiator : Service Provider SAML nameID format : Email Click on the Save to save your configuration changes. You may configure any additional access details, such as users accessing this app in their portal for testing the integration under the User tab. Click on the SSO tab, and you will need to gather the information on this page and send it to Lytics for configuration of the Service Provider: X.509 Certificate (click View Details to see the full cert). Issuer URL SLO Endpoint (HTTP) Once Lytics has completed the service provider implementation, you may begin to test the SSO implementation through your OneLogin portal. Updated 3 months ago",
